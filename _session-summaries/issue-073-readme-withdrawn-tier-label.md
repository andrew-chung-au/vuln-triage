# Issue #073: README withdrawn status and Stage 5 tier-label note

Tool: Claude Code (cloud session), branch `claude/tender-volta-wiq6xv`. Base commit `25960f5`.

## What was done

Worked #73 following `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`, with PM, Engineer and QA run as subagents, beside another session working roadmap step 13 (`_docs/plan-summary.md`).

- **PM** (6334306395): confirmed README line 27 omits `withdrawn` (spec US-11 and the status table have four statuses); corrected the Stage 5 line numbers; found the issue's "not ... any architecture tier" wording wrong, because the `Tier` column in `_docs/architecture.md` and (A1) use the same rubric Tier A/B/C.
- **Human decisions** (orchestrator comment 6334352037): 1 = A (the sentence says Tier A/B/C is the rubric tiers, the same as the architecture `Tier` column, never P1-P4); 2 = A (leave `_docs/project-brief.md`'s missing `withdrawn`); 3 = A (no roadmap edit on this branch; changes that would conflict with step 13 go to a follow-up issue).
- **Engineer** (6334375597): `0aa61b1` (README line 27; one Stage 5 sentence in `_docs/planning-process.md`), `6248c29` (usage-log entry).
- **QA: PASS** at `6248c29` (6334401494). `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD unchanged afterwards.
- **Decision point:** no protected-file change, no spec note. QA's four risks went into the follow-up issue #92 (section C) at the human's direction; #92 also holds the deferred README link, roadmap check-ins (including this issue's), the roadmap line 137 conflict marker, and deployment-task inputs from the human's course material (comment 6334435319).

## Verification

`make verify BASE=25960f5`: PASS (62 tests, type check, whitespace; no test files changed). The pre-push hook re-ran it: PASS.

## Roadmap check-in (not in `_docs/roadmap.md`, by decision 3)

2026-10-22 | none in the sequence; #73 done | 10 (2026-10-20 audit) | yes | Housekeeping beside step 13; README `withdrawn`, Stage 5 tier sentence; QA PASS 6334401494; follow-up #92. To be added to the roadmap by #92 item 2.

## Approval records

None (no protected file changed).

## Cleanup

No processes started; no system changes. `make clean-scratch` ran before this summary was committed.

## Permission review

All roles reported "none". Orchestrator actions: `make issue-comment` on #73 and #92 (allowed target); creating #92 through the GitHub MCP tool (issue creation, at the human's request in this session); `git push -u origin claude/tender-volta-wiq6xv` (cloud-session exception); `make issue-close N=73` (ask rule). Grouping: issue comments and creation, push and close are writes to the record (keep asking); nothing read-only or risky to propose.
