# VulnTriage plan summary (Stage 6)

Status: Stage 6 deliverable, draft for review; the register, completeness counts and line locations were refreshed at commit `8bdb0fc` (#108 stage 1)

Sources: [`_docs/rubric.md`](rubric.md), [`_docs/project-brief.md`](project-brief.md), [`_docs/specs.md`](specs.md), [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md), [`_docs/api.md`](api.md), [`_docs/testing.md`](testing.md), [`_docs/tasks.md`](tasks.md), [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) and [`_docs/reviews/2026-10-16-final-rubric-impact.md`](reviews/2026-10-16-final-rubric-impact.md).

## How to read

- This is **planned coverage, not evidence**. [`_docs/rubric-evidence.md`](rubric-evidence.md) is the only record of what is currently MET, PARTIAL or MISSING; no row here awards points or claims a status.
- Criterion names, order and maximum points are copied verbatim from [`_docs/rubric.md`](rubric.md) (12 criteria, 24 points, 10 to pass).
- `task N` means the `## N.` heading in [`_docs/tasks.md`](tasks.md); it is not a GitHub issue number. Issue numbers, where they exist, are cross-references only.
- Milestones A, B and C and their targets (A 12, B 19, C 24 points) are the targets in [`_docs/reviews/2026-10-16-final-rubric-impact.md`](reviews/2026-10-16-final-rubric-impact.md) §5 and [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) §Tier B and Tier C milestones. They are targets, not current evidence.
- Submission and showcase: the submission scope is tasks 1-29, 37 and 38 (decisions H2-H7: Terraform, one server for dev and prod, GHCR, `sslip.io`, observability and the responder in local Compose, the backend delivering the top-tier notification and running the schedule). Tasks 30-36 (LLM brief, MCP server, n8n) are in the "Showcase (post-submission)" section of [`_docs/tasks.md`](tasks.md) and are not in the rubric map. A register entry whose owner is a task numbered 30-36 is showcase scope, and no submission task depends on one.
- Duplicate coverage is explicit and allowed: a task may serve several criteria, and a criterion may need several tasks.
- In the register, keys are `file:tag` because tags repeat across files (for example `architecture.md:A1` and `api.md:A1 (#27)` are different entries). Status values are `open`, `proposed answer`, `resolved`, `deferred` and `VERIFY`. Line numbers were read at commit `8bdb0fc` (with the #108 edits) and may move.

**Total: 24 points; pass mark 10** ([`_docs/rubric.md`](rubric.md) line 4). The 12 rows above are in rubric order. Showcase tasks 30-36 add no mapped row; tasks 31 and 36 add Testing evidence after submission, and the Testing row does not depend on them.

¹ `_docs/tasks.md` §Coverage summary assigns the end-to-end application to tasks 1, 3-12 and 14, and notes that the criterion's "runs locally with a single command" clause is supplied in Tier A by `make dev` (task 11, backend on SQLite and frontend together, no Docker; #108 stage 2), with task 15 (the Compose stack) as the container variant that [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) B2 assigns to Application. Task 15's own `Covers:` line names only Containerization. See Source discrepancies D1 (resolved). The caveat does not unmask the row: tasks 1, 3-12 and 14 already cover the end-to-end application, and Tier A no longer waits for task 15 for the single-command clause.

## Source discrepancies

| # | Sources | Difference | Handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | [`_docs/tasks.md`](tasks.md) §Coverage summary vs [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) B2 | tasks.md lists Application tasks as 1, 3-12 and 14; roadmap B2 assigns Application to task 15 (Compose stack, the "single command" clause), but task 15's `Covers:` line names only Containerization | **Resolved in #95:** [`_docs/tasks.md`](tasks.md) §Coverage summary now separates the two Application clauses: the row lists tasks 1, 3-12 and 14 for the end-to-end application, and a note records the criterion's "runs locally with a single command" clause (in #108 stage 2 the Tier A supplier became `make dev` in task 11, and task 15, the Compose stack, is the container variant). [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) B2 assigns Application to task 15 for the container variant. Task 15's own `Covers:` line still names only Containerization, and no task was renumbered, added or removed. Cross-referenced from the Application row's footnote ¹. |
| D2 | [`_docs/specs.md`](specs.md) line 3 vs §Open questions | The status line says "reviewed", but Open questions 2-4 remain open while architecture proposes answers | Register keeps Q2-Q4 as `proposed answer`; spec wording change is a proposed follow-up, not applied. |
| D3 | [`_docs/specs.md`](specs.md) Open question 2 vs [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) A27 | Q2 is open; A27 proposes P1 7 / P2 14 / P3 30 / P4 90 days | Both kept; A27 is a proposed answer pending human confirmation. |
| D4 | [`_docs/specs.md`](specs.md) Open questions 3-4 vs [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) A26, A33 | Q3 (channel) and Q4 (US-14 window) are open; A26 proposes email (the backend sends it: MailHog in development and tests, Amazon SES in AWS) and A33 proposes 30 minutes | Both kept; no answer is treated as resolved. |
| D5 | [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) D1 vs [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) Open question 6 | D1 proposed closing Q6 with the Module 4 pattern; Q6 was listed as open | **Resolved (checked in #107):** roadmap D1 is resolved (H3, as adapted by H2-H4) and `architecture.md` Open question 6 is closed; the register rows match. |
| D6 | [`README.md`](../README.md) line 27 vs [`_docs/specs.md`](specs.md) §Finding statuses | README listed dashboard statuses as `open`, `risk accepted`, `fixed`; the spec's complete list adds `withdrawn` | **Resolved by #73 (checked in #107):** `README.md` line 27 now lists `open`, `risk accepted`, `fixed`, `withdrawn`, matching the spec. |
| D7 | [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) §Open decisions | The table numbers 18 rows: rows 1-4 are resolved/withdrawn, rows 5-11 carry the labels D1-D7, and rows 12-18 are the decisions H1-H7 (all resolved) | Register keys the decisions `roadmap.md:D1`-`roadmap.md:D7`; D1, D2, D3, D6 and D7 are resolved, D4 and D5 stay open. H1-H7 are not register entries; they are recorded in the roadmap and applied to the documents. |
| D8 | [`_docs/specs.md`](specs.md) §Assumptions bullet 1 (line 436) vs [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) A16, A17 | The spec's assumption wording about asset criticality values ("small fixed set; final values in Stage 2") predates the values the human confirmed on 2026-10-22 | The spec wording is left as written (the spec is human-owned) and aligned at the next approved spec change; architecture A16 and A17 are the confirmed text. |

## Top risks

Every mitigation has an owner. A mitigation labelled `human` is a human-only action (account, domain, dev-container rebuild, production approval, teardown); no destructive or account-creating step is assigned to the Engineer.

| # | Risk (coverage area) | Source | Trigger / impact | Mitigation | Owner | Step / milestone | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | No Docker in the local sandbox; Docker/Compose environment is human-dependent (a) | [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) §Project gotchas; [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) T2, T3, prerequisites; #31/#48 | `docker compose up`, Postgres integration and the Compose telemetry/alert jobs cannot run in the sandbox; Containerization, the Application single-command clause and Compose Testing wait | Compose dev-container recipe (#31), cloud `docker-start` (#48), Compose jobs in CI; Tier A uses only the local no-Docker rows ([`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) §Development environment) | `human` for the dev-container rebuild; agents for the CI jobs | T2, T3; B2, C3 | Rebuild or cloud route can slip; Tier A is unaffected |
| R2 | AWS account, budget, Terraform, `sslip.io` HTTPS and the GitHub `production` environment (b) | [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) prerequisites, B4-B6; [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) §Deployment, Open question 7 (closed: no domain, `sslip.io`) | Tasks 17, 18 and 21 cannot deploy; Deployment and the CD half of CI/CD stay at 0-1 points | Budget alert before any stack (A37); the human installs Terraform and runs the bootstrap and every apply; check Let's Encrypt limits for shared `sslip.io` names and the `production` protection rules at build time (both carry `VERIFY:` in the architecture); use the "If AWS is slow" order if it delays; the HTTPS fallback (staging certificate, then `nip.io`) and the nightly-stop rules (24-hour catch-up, a deploy to a stopped server skipped and reported, the stop switched off while graders may visit) are named in `architecture.md` Deployment | `human` for the account, budget, Terraform apply and production approval; agents write the Terraform and runbook | B4-B6; S3 | Schedule risk; D5 fallback (Compose/kind demo) is named but not chosen |
| R3 | Unresolved responder runtime (submission) and LLM provider/model (showcase) (c) | [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) A23, Open question 9, §Responder agent; [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) prerequisites | Task 28 and C6 cannot pin a runtime, and showcase task 30 cannot pin a model; tests and CI must not call a paid provider | Choose the responder runtime with the human before task 28/C6; choose the LLM provider when the showcase starts, before task 30; `RESPONDER_MODE=stub` and `LLM_MODE=stub` in tests; the 20 s timeout and the "brief unavailable" path keep the product working once the brief is built | `human` chooses; agents implement the stubs | Task 28, C6; task 30 (Showcase) | Provider capabilities, pricing and retention remain `VERIFY:` |
| R4 | External API unknowns, fixture capture and no live feeds in CI (d) | [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) §External data sources; `VERIFY:` items in [`_docs/api.md`](api.md) and [`_docs/testing.md`](testing.md) | OSV/KEV/EPSS/GitHub/SES/LLM/Grafana details may differ; live feeds would make tests flaky or need secrets | Committed fixtures plus `U-NET`/`I-NET` network guards; deliberate `make record-fixtures` capture; resolve each `VERIFY:` at its build task. Email route (human decision, 2026-10-22, task 37): the backend sends through the Amazon SES API using the server's instance role, with one verified sender address because `sslip.io` hostnames cannot carry SES domain DKIM records; development and tests send to MailHog in the Compose stack (task 24; MailHog is a dependency, ask before adding). `VERIFY:` SES sandbox recipients (the demo recipient must be verified too). `VERIFY:` the current free allowance and sending limits. `VERIFY:` the instance-role permission, action and resource form. `VERIFY:` the SES region | Agents; `human` approves dependency additions (MailHog, the AWS SDK client) and deliberate captures | Tasks 5, 6, 13, 16, 37; B2/B3 | Fixtures drift from live feeds until re-captured; an unverified demo recipient blocks a real send |
| R5 | Telemetry exclusions and advisory prompt injection (e) | [`_docs/specs.md`](specs.md) US-13, US-15; [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) §Security boundaries, §Observability | Excluded data (advisory text, owner contact, repository URL, lockfile content, credentials) could reach telemetry; advisory text could steer the responder or a notification (and, in the showcase, the brief) | Allowlist helper in code plus a Collector processor; `T-REFUSE`; `S-*` per flow; responder read-only tokens and "untrusted data" instructions; alert labels carry finding id and tier only | Agents | Tasks 23-25, 28-29; C2-C6 | Auto-instrumented attributes can leak if the allowlist misses a key |
| R6 | Scope and schedule: Tier C estimate above the course's ~20 hours; tasks 37 and 38 added to the submission scope; the LLM/MCP/n8n work moved to the showcase (f) | [`_docs/reviews/2026-10-16-final-rubric-impact.md`](reviews/2026-10-16-final-rubric-impact.md) §5; [`_docs/tasks.md`](tasks.md) Submission additions and Showcase (post-submission) | 26-30 h estimate exceeds ~20 h; tasks 37 and 38 add backend work to the scoring path | Scoring path first (Milestones A-B-C with tasks 37 and 38); Showcase tasks 30-36 only after submission; Tier A passes at 12 points; shrink the application slice or accept the overrun at the human's decision | `human` owns scope/time; orchestrator/PM own sequence | S1-S5; all milestones | Tier C overrun is accepted or the application shrinks |
| R7 | Step 12 backlog filing is `doing`; step 14 depends on steps 11 and 13 and "Milestone A filed" (g) | [`_docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) steps 12-14 and check-in 2026-10-22; human decision Q1 option 1, 2026-10-22 | The Milestone B, C and Committed issues, including the submission tasks 37 and 38, are not all filed; the plan review sees Milestone A issues only | This summary maps task numbers, not issue numbers; the Milestone B, C and Committed issues are filed at their boundaries after S1 starts and no longer gate step 14; the summary does not claim those issues exist | Orchestrator/PM; `human` approves filing | Steps 12-14 | A later-filed issue can differ from the task it maps; the map is re-checked at each filing (R9) |
| R8 | The demo defect must be removed before production (h) | [`_docs/tasks.md`](tasks.md) task 29; [`_docs/testing.md`](testing.md) §Responder (`P-FLAG-GONE`); [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) A35 | `VT_DEMO_DEFECT=notify_no_fix` could remain in production code, leaving a deliberate failure path | Production startup refuses the flag (`P-PROD-REFUSAL`); `P-FLAG-GONE` blocks promotion until the path is gone; cleanup commit/PR; promotion stays manual | Agents write and remove the path; `human` merges and promotes | Task 29; C6-C7 | A bypass of the manual gate could still promote the flag, so the test is the guard |
| R9 | Mapping and points drift as stage documents change (i) | [`_docs/rubric.md`](rubric.md); [`_docs/tasks.md`](tasks.md); any later stage edit | A later edit can add/remove a task or change a `Covers:` line, invalidating a row; scores could be read as current | Task numbers are canonical; re-check this map after any stage-document change; the auditor alone updates [`_docs/rubric-evidence.md`](rubric-evidence.md); this document records conflicts instead of editing sources | Orchestrator/PM; reviewer at step 14 | Steps 12-14 and after any stage change | A stale row can survive until the next check |
| R10 | An exploited vulnerability with no CVE cannot reach `P1` or `P2` | [`_docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) § Prioritisation, Open question 10 (closed); [`_docs/specs.md`](specs.md) E11 | The KEV and EPSS inputs both key on a CVE id, so an exploited finding with no CVE is ranked by the lower tiers only | Accepted as documented; the sentence in architecture § Prioritisation states it, and the tier tests (task 7) follow the rules as written | `human` accepted, 2026-10-22 | Task 7 | An exploited no-CVE finding can sit below `P2`; accepted, not a defect. Check: the sentence exists in architecture § Prioritisation |

## Open questions and assumptions

Scope per source follows the Stage 6 issue: `specs.md` open questions 1-5 and every `ASSUMPTION:` (including inline ones); `architecture.md` open questions 1-11 and A1-A41; `api.md` `ASSUMPTION:` items and unresolved `VERIFY:` items; `testing.md` `T-A1`-`T-A8` and `VERIFY:` rows; `tasks.md` `ASSUMPTION:` and `VERIFY:` lines; `roadmap.md` live decisions D1-D7 as a separate group. The brief has no labelled items. No item is renumbered or deleted; resolved items keep their entry.

### `_docs/architecture.md`: assumptions

All entries are listed under §Assumptions. A7, A12 and A14 were retired into spec rules in the second #43 spec commit; their numbers are not reused, so active IDs are A1-A6, A8-A11, A13, A15-A41.

| Key | Item | Status | Owner / where resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| `architecture.md:A1` | Tiers: Postgres and n8n are Tier B; the MCP server is Tier A on the developer's machine | proposed answer | Engineer, tasks 1/15/32; step 14 |
| `architecture.md:A2` | n8n and Grafana use their default embedded stores on their own volumes | proposed answer | Engineer, task 15 |
| `architecture.md:A3` | Re-scans: daily schedule after refresh (the backend's own scheduler for submission; the n8n schedule is showcase) plus a person's on-demand action; registration starts the first scan | proposed answer | Engineer, tasks 8/38 (n8n variant: showcase task 33) |
| `architecture.md:A4` | Scans and briefs run as background jobs in the backend with a job table and one worker | proposed answer | Engineer, task 4 (the worker and job table; reused by tasks 37 and 38) |
| `architecture.md:A5` | Lockfiles are looked for at the repository root only | proposed answer | Engineer, task 4 |
| `architecture.md:A6` | One finding per package across several files; highest per-entry fixed version; `fixed` only when every entry is clear | proposed answer | Engineer, task 5 |
| `architecture.md:A8` | `uv.lock` and `package-lock.json` entry handling, including lockfileVersion 1 as a parse error | proposed answer | Engineer, task 4 |
| `architecture.md:A9` | `requirements.txt` handling for `-c`, `-e`, VCS/URL requirements and index options | proposed answer | Engineer, task 4 |
| `architecture.md:A10` | OSV's match is the candidate set; a range disagreement keeps the finding with a warning | proposed answer | Engineer, task 5 |
| `architecture.md:A11` | `last_affected`-only or open-ended intervals give no fixed version | proposed answer | Engineer, task 5 |
| `architecture.md:A13` | Enum values are stored and sent exactly as the spec writes them | proposed answer | Engineer, task 3 |
| `architecture.md:A15` | Alias-joined vulnerabilities merge; the earlier finding keeps its id and lifecycle | proposed answer | Engineer, task 5 |
| `architecture.md:A16` | Criticality values are final as `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` | resolved | Confirmed by the human, 2026-10-22; task 3 |
| `architecture.md:A17` | Only criticality `critical` counts as "critical" in the tier rules | resolved | Confirmed by the human, 2026-10-22; task 7 |
| `architecture.md:A18` | The EPSS threshold T is 0.10 | resolved | Confirmed by the human, 2026-10-22; task 7 |
| `architecture.md:A19` | "Oldest finding" uses first detection time; the final tie-break is finding id | proposed answer | Engineer, task 7 |
| `architecture.md:A20` | Tiers cover `open` and `risk accepted`; the ranked list is `open` only; E8 escalation means a tier rise or becoming `KEV: listed` | proposed answer | Engineer, task 7 |
| `architecture.md:A21` | An email-only owner is notified; a name-only owner's notification is held | proposed answer | Engineer, task 10 |
| `architecture.md:A22` | The brief prompt includes the advisory summary, truncated to 500 characters | proposed answer | Engineer, task 30 |
| `architecture.md:A23` | LLM provider chosen with the human; 20 s timeout; brief cached per lifecycle, fixed version, prompt version and model | open | `human` chooses; Engineer task 30; R3 |
| `architecture.md:A24` | The brief output check rejects other version tokens and any URL in text fields | proposed answer | Engineer, task 30 |
| `architecture.md:A25` | n8n polls every 5 minutes; refresh 06:00 UTC; digest Monday 08:00 UTC | proposed answer | Engineer, tasks 33/35 (showcase); the 06:00 UTC refresh also times task 38 |

### `_docs/roadmap.md`: live decisions D1-D7

Rows 1-4 of the roadmap's decision table are resolved or withdrawn and are not live; D1-D7 are table rows 5-11.

| Key | Item | Status | Owner / next step |
|---|---|---|---|
| `roadmap.md:D1` | Close architecture Open question 6 with the Module 4 description (the roadmap's original wording: one EC2 instance per environment, Compose, ECR, CloudFormation; adapted by H2-H4: Terraform, one server for both environments, GHCR, as `architecture.md` Open question 6 records) | resolved | Resolved in the roadmap's Open decisions (human, 2026-10-22): yes, with one server for both environments (H3); architecture Q6 |
| `roadmap.md:D2` | Adopt the course image tag `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-shortsha` and add `service.version` (the tag) to the telemetry allowlist (A32) | resolved | Resolved in the roadmap (kept; the tag works with GHCR); `service.version` added to `architecture.md` A32 in #107; tasks 17/21 |
| `roadmap.md:D3` | Domain name and TLS approach for the public URL | resolved | Resolved in the roadmap, decided by H5 (`sslip.io`, no domain; `architecture.md` Open question 7 closed) |
| `roadmap.md:D4` | Add to US-15 that a false positive or test alert makes the responder explain and change nothing | open | `human`; `specs.md` is protected; C6 |
| `roadmap.md:D5` | Fallback if AWS is not available in time (kind cluster or local Compose demo) | open | `human` names the fallback date at B4 |
| `roadmap.md:D6` | Move n8n tasks 33 and 34 ahead of task 25 and add task 34 to tasks 25 and 28's `Depends on:` | resolved | Resolved in the roadmap (moot): H7 made n8n showcase and the backend delivers (task 37); the new build-order dependency is task 37's, in `tasks.md` Build order |
| `roadmap.md:D7` | At filing, split task 21 (dev vs prod) and task 24 (Compose vs `vt-observability`) | resolved | Resolved in the roadmap; applied in `tasks.md` by #99: task 21 is the dev deploy (17, 19), the production workflow is in task 18, task 24 is Compose only (23) |

### `_docs/project-brief.md`

No labelled items: 0 open questions, 0 `ASSUMPTION:` and 0 `VERIFY:` (read-only `.scratch/` extraction). It is the fixed input, not a source of open items.

### `_docs/plan-summary.md` (self-assumptions)

| Key | Item | Status | Owner / where resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plan-summary.md:P-A1` | `ASSUMPTION:` The earliest milestone in a rubric row is the earliest milestone among the `tasks.md` tasks that §Coverage summary assigns to that criterion; the Application/task 15 caveat does not move its milestone | proposed answer | PM/orchestrator at step 14 |
| `plan-summary.md:P-A2` | `ASSUMPTION:` `_docs/specs.md`'s `VERIFY:` markers are external-detail checks, outside the Stage 1 register scope; they are tracked in architecture §External data sources and risk R4 | proposed answer | PM/orchestrator at step 14 |

## Completeness check

Counts come from the read-only label-only `.scratch/` extraction (`count_labels.py`), which matches only the literal tags `ASSUMPTION:` and `VERIFY:`. Prose, headings, `make verify` and the unlabelled word "assumption" are not counted. An unexplained difference would be a FAIL; every difference below is explained, and the exact line locations follow the table.

| Source | Open questions / decisions | `ASSUMPTION:` labels (occurrences / lines) | `VERIFY:` labels (occurrences / lines) | Captured | Difference and explanation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `_docs/project-brief.md` | 0 | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | 0 | No labelled items |
| `_docs/specs.md` | 5 | 6 / 6 | 14 / 13 (out of scope) | 9 | The 6 assumption labels are 5 distinct meanings: line 226 is the US-9 windows assumption and is recorded in `specs.md:Q2`; lines 319 and 410 are the same `withdrawn` addition (one row); lines 436, 438 and 440 are the three §Assumptions rows. Spec `VERIFY:` labels are external-detail checks outside the Stage 1 register scope (P-A2) |
| `_docs/architecture.md` | 11 | 38 / 29 | 72 / 55 (out of scope) | 49 | The 38 labelled tags are exactly A1-A6, A8-A11, A13 and A15-A41; A7/A12/A14 are retired and not reused, so there is no assumption difference. `VERIFY:` labels are tracked per §External data sources and risk R4, not as separate register rows |
| `_docs/api.md` | 0 | 2 / 2 | 13 / 12 | 13 | Both A1 labels (#27 at line 77, #50 at line 78) are separate rows. The 13 VERIFY occurrences are 11 distinct items: line 336 carries two labels (OpenAPI generation and the validator), and the Secrets Manager item occurs on lines 77, 78 and 344 and is one row listing all three |
| `_docs/testing.md` | 0 | 15 / 15 (14 tagged; 8 distinct T-A) | 22 / 22 | 26 | Line 5 is the conventions definition, so the 14 tagged occurrences are the 8 T-A rows. The 22 VERIFY labels are 21 item mentions (line 5 is a definition) and 18 distinct rows (three labels were closed in #108 stage 2, and their register row stays as `resolved`): the fake mail sink's form is the former #107 row and is now decided (an injected transport that records messages), how the Compose test reads MailHog (line 129) is the other row added in #107, line 130 is the SES sandbox item already in the `tasks.md` rows, line 276 supplies the Grafana instance row, and the table at lines 415-423 repeats items already named inline |
| `_docs/tasks.md` | 0 | 2 / 2 | 7 / 3 | 7 | Lines 95 and 295 are one assumption row (task 15/17 follow T-A1 and architecture §Deployment). Line 107 (task 17) carries one VERIFY label, the existing-OIDC-provider row added in #108. Line 191 (task 37) carries four VERIFY labels, the SES sandbox recipients, the free allowance and limits, the instance-role permission and the SES region, each its own row. Line 295 carries two: one is a cross-reference to architecture's existing tags, the other is the Juice Shop lockfile row. Recounted at `8bdb0fc` (#108) |
| `_docs/roadmap.md` | 7 live decisions (D1-D7) | 0 / 0 | 6 / 6 (out of scope) | 7 | The decision table has 18 rows; rows 1-4 are resolved/withdrawn and rows 12-18 are the resolved H1-H7, so the 7 D-rows (rows 5-11) are captured. The 6 VERIFY labels (69, 70, 125, 126, 139, 217) are step and milestone external details outside the decision register; the mention of the literal tag at line 291 is prose in a check-in row, not a label |
| `_docs/plan-summary.md` | 0 | 2 / 2 (self) | 4 / 1 (restated) | 2 | P-A1 and P-A2 are labelled `ASSUMPTION:` and added here. Risk R4 restates task 37's four SES `VERIFY:` labels once; they are the four `tasks.md` rows above and add no new row |

Register total: 9 + 49 + 13 + 26 + 7 + 7 + 2 = **113 entries** (112 before #108, which included the 2 self-assumptions and the two `testing.md` mail VERIFY rows added in #107, plus the `tasks.md` OIDC provider VERIFY row added in #108).

All counts and locations in this section were recounted at commit `8bdb0fc` (#108) with a read-only `.scratch/` script that matches the literal tags `ASSUMPTION:` and `VERIFY:`. `tasks.md` was recounted at the same commit, and #108 adds one `tasks.md` register row for a label that was already in the file (line 107); this file's own edits add no tagged label.

Label locations (1-based line numbers, read at `8bdb0fc`):

## Stage 6 checklist

| Item | Result | How checked |
|---|---|---|
| All 12 criteria appear | PASS | [`_docs/rubric.md`](rubric.md) has 12 `######` criterion headings; the map has exactly 12 data rows in the same order with the same names (`.scratch/check_map.py`) |
| Max points total 24 and the pass mark is 10 | PASS | [`_docs/rubric.md`](rubric.md) line 4 and the per-criterion headings; the map's Max column is 2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+3+2+1+2 = 24, and the total line states 24/10 |
| Nothing is unmapped | PASS | Every map row has at least one `task N` and at least one resolving document link; the Gaps table is empty. The Application/task 15 difference is recorded as D1, and the row is still covered by tasks 1, 3-12 and 14 (and 37, 38). Rerun after #99: 12 rows, each with at least one existing task |
| Every task number exists | PASS | `.scratch/check_map.py` matched every `task N` to a `## N.` heading in [`_docs/tasks.md`](tasks.md) and found no number outside 1-38 (rerun after #99 with `.scratch/check_plan99.py`; the headings are 1-38) |
| Every risk has a mitigation | PASS | Top risks has 10 rows (R1-R10, more than 8); every row has a non-empty mitigation, owner and residual risk. Human-only actions are labelled `human` |
| All open questions and assumptions are collected | PASS | Corrected label-only recount: 6 specs assumption labels (5 meanings; `specs.md:Q2` covers line 152), 38 architecture A tags, 2 api A1 entries, 14 tagged testing T-A occurrences (8 items), 7 tasks entries (1 assumption row from 2 labels, task 17's OIDC provider `VERIFY:` row, task 37's four SES `VERIFY:` rows and the Juice Shop lockfile row, recounted at `8bdb0fc`), 0 roadmap labels, plus 2 self-assumptions = 113 register entries after the #108 recount at `8bdb0fc` (the `tasks.md` OIDC provider VERIFY row added; the two `testing.md` mail VERIFY rows were added in #107); every difference is explained and the locations are listed above |
| Links resolve | PASS | `.scratch/check_links.py` checked every relative Markdown link in this file and the new README line; all resolve |
| File limit | PASS | For #99, `git status --short` before the commit lists only `_docs/tasks.md` and `_docs/plan-summary.md` as this issue's changes. (At the first Stage 6 commit the limit was `_docs/plan-summary.md` and `README.md`.) |

## Gaps

None. Every criterion has at least one `_docs/tasks.md` task and at least one existing repository document. The Application/task 15 difference is a source discrepancy (D1), not an unmapped criterion.
