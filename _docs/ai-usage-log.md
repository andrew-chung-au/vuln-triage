# AI usage log

Append-only record of AI-assisted work, kept for rubric criteria 2
(AI-assisted development workflow) and 13 (security, audit, and DevOps
hardening). Append one entry per task; facts only — never record a review
or verification that did not happen. Where the prompt, model, or
verification is not recorded in the repo, write literally `not recorded`
(for prompt/model) or `none` (for verification/human review) rather than
guessing. Key prompts that define a role, stage, or task are saved verbatim
in `_docs/prompts/` and linked from the entry.

## Entry template

### 2026-10-16 — install Claude Code layer alongside OpenCode

- date: 2026-10-16
- task/issue: install the agent kit's Claude Code layer (`_docs/agent-kit/claude-code/START.md`, steps 2-5) without clashing with the OpenCode layer; Claude Code is to supervise/review OpenCode's work
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human instruction in-session ("help me set up the claude code layer. make sure it does not clash with opencode. I will use claude code to supervise/review the work opencode has done."); no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`

- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (no TEST_CMD: no code exists; whitespace PASS; no test files changed). START.md step 6 checks (`/agents`, `/hooks`, `/permissions`, guard test) not yet run: they need a Claude Code restart
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human approved the protected edits to `agent-kit.conf` and `opencode.json` and chose to include the pending opencode.json change in this commit

### 2026-10-16 — independent plan review of Stage 1 (at 27d4760)

- date: 2026-10-16
- task/issue: independent review of the planning documents written so far (brief, rubric, planning process, `_docs/specs.md`); Stages 2-6 not yet written
- agent role: Reviewer (Claude Code, independent of the OpenCode planning agent)
- model: claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human-pasted reviewer prompt in-session (find errors, gaps, scope, checkability, unmarked external API facts, feasibility, security; write only the review and this log entry); not saved to `_docs/prompts/` because the instruction limited the files written (raised as a question in the review)
- files changed: `_docs/reviews/2026-10-16-plan-review.md` (new), `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): reviewer verdict FAIL (2 High, 10 Medium, 6 Low findings; 6 questions for the human); `make verify` run before commit
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none

### 2026-10-16 — turn plan review findings into GitHub issues

- date: 2026-10-16
- task/issue: convert `_docs/reviews/2026-10-16-plan-review.md` (ba39c5c) into GitHub issues #3-#9; record the human's decisions on the review questions
- agent role: Reviewer (Claude Code)
- model: claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human-pasted instruction in-session (one issue per High finding, Medium/Low grouped by topic in at most 5 issues, a carry-forward issue for later stages, task-template bodies, VERIFY: on feed assumptions, show titles before creating), then approval with changes (coverage check, Depends-on lines, recorded decisions); not saved as a key prompt (task instruction, not a role or stage definition)
- files changed: `_docs/plan-review.md` renamed to `_docs/plan-review-2026-10-12-superseded.md` with a superseded first line (human decision); `_docs/prompts/reviewer-plan-review.md` (new, Reviewer prompt verbatim, human decision); `_docs/prompts/README.md` (index row); `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry)
- GitHub issues created: #3 finding 1 (fixed version), #4 finding 2 (CVE aliases), #5 findings 4/7/8/9 (feeds and ingestion), #6 findings 3/10/13/16/17 (status and audit; depends on #3), #7 findings 5/6/15 (notifications; decisions on issue destination and issue-close sync), #8 findings 11/14 (security boundaries; depends on #7), #9 carry into later stages (findings 1, 2, 4, 11, 12, 15, 18 by stage; cloud hosting decision open). Coverage checked: findings 1-18 each appear in at least one issue; split findings (1, 2, 4, 11, 15) say which part each issue handles
- human decisions recorded: specs.md is a draft until the review issues are resolved (in #3); cloud hosting target left open (in #9)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): issue numbers checked against each `gh issue create` result before cross-references were written; `make verify` run before commit; issue links point at ba39c5c, which resolve only after the human pushes
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human approved the issue titles and grouping and asked for the coverage check, Depends-on lines and recorded decisions before creation

### 2026-10-16 — QA re-check of issue #1 at ba39c5c (fresh PASS)

- date: 2026-10-16
- task/issue: issue #1 — fresh full QA check at current HEAD ba39c5c (prior PASS at 0b2a18f was stale after e496aa5, c22a657, 3f6a919, 27d4760, ba39c5c)
- agent role: QA Engineer (subagent; entry appended by Orchestrator per the write-only-.scratch/ role limit)

- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none

### 2026-10-16 — PM files follow-up issue #2 (role log-entry contradiction)

- date: 2026-10-16
- task/issue: file approved follow-up for the QA-flagged risk that PM/QA role files contradict themselves (write-only-.scratch/ vs append to `_docs/ai-usage-log.md`); the 3 earlier-drafted follow-ups (prompts index, first audit, report content) stay deferred per human decision
- agent role: PM (Product Manager subagent; entry appended by Orchestrator per the write-only-.scratch/ role limit)
- model: opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): orchestrator instruction citing the human's decision-point approval to file exactly one follow-up; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: none in working tree (body drafted in `.scratch/followup-pm-qa-log-body.md`, removed by `make clean-scratch`)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none (no code changed; new issue #2 returned with URL https://github.com/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/2)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human approved filing this follow-up and deferring the other three at the issue #1 decision point

### 2026-10-16 — PM grooms issue #2 (orchestrator-appends rule)

- date: 2026-10-16
- task/issue: issue #2 — groom to task template (Goal + 7 checkable criteria + Out of scope + Constraints); recommend single rule (roles write only to `.scratch/`, orchestrator appends log entry after assert-clean)
- agent role: PM (Product Manager subagent; entry appended by Orchestrator per the write-only-.scratch/ role limit)
- model: opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): orchestrator instruction to groom #2 per `_docs/agent-kit/team/pm.md` using `_docs/agent-kit/templates/task-template.md`; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: none in working tree (draft in `.scratch/issue-2-groomed.md`, later replaced by `.scratch/issue-2-groomed-v2.md`; both removed by `make clean-scratch`)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none (no code changed)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human confirmed the orchestrator-appends rule, chose keep-#2-PM/QA-only plus follow-up, and approved updating #2 with the groomed text

- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (no TEST_CMD: planning phase, no code exists; whitespace PASS; no test files changed); `git diff --check` clean; report posted as issue comment 6218874639
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human approved this exact diff before the protected commit

### 2026-10-16 — QA checks issue #2 at 2dcc89d (PASS)

### 2026-10-16 — Add `make issue-dump` target and protect the Makefile (commits f999cd6, fc29661)

- date: 2026-10-16
- task/issue: add a Makefile target so fetching a long issue needs no shell redirect or script; add the matching Commands line to `AGENTS.md`; add `Makefile` to the PROTECTED list
- agent role: Orchestrator
- model: opencode/space-bunny-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): user instruction to add the target with the supplied Make recipe and the `Fetch an issue` Commands line, to show both diffs before committing, and to add `Makefile` to PROTECTED; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `Makefile` (new `# --- Project targets (not from the kit) ---` section with `ISSUE_DIGITS_LEFT` validation and the `issue-dump` target; 13 insertions, commit f999cd6); `AGENTS.md` (`Fetch an issue` Commands line; 1 insertion, commit f999cd6); `agent-kit.conf` (`Makefile` added to PROTECTED; 1 insertion, commit fc29661)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (no TEST_CMD: planning phase, no code exists; whitespace PASS; no test files changed) over 14 files / 368 insertions vs origin/main; `make issue-dump` with no N exits non-zero with `Usage: make issue-dump N=<issue number>`; `make issue-dump N=11a` exits non-zero with `N must be an issue number`; `make issue-dump N=11` wrote `.scratch/issue-11.json` (10910 bytes) containing body, title, state, labels and comments; `make help` lists `issue-dump`; `git diff --check` clean; recipe lines confirmed as tabs
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human approved the Makefile and `AGENTS.md` diffs and the `agent-kit.conf` PROTECTED addition, each committed with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`; human corrected two facts — `Makefile` was not protected before this entry, and the Makefile had no project section until this change created one

### 2026-10-16 — PM grooms issue #11 (final rubric impact)

- date: 2026-10-16
- task/issue: issue #11 — groom to task template; confront the missing verbatim criteria text; fix stale open-issue range
- agent role: PM (Product Manager subagent; entry appended by Orchestrator per the write-only-.scratch/ role limit)
- model: opencode/space-bunny-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): orchestrator instruction to groom #11 per `_docs/agent-kit/team/pm.md`, with instructions to confront the placeholder text and the stale issue range; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: none in working tree (draft in `.scratch/issue-11-groomed.md`)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none (no code changed); PM read all five planning documents named in the issue; PM confirmed `_docs/rubric.md` is not in `agent-kit.conf` PROTECTED and that #2 is closed and #10 is open
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human supplied the full final Criteria text into the issue's Source section, answering the PM's blocker question; human corrected the PM's read of the source by updating the issue rather than the PM re-grooming it

### 2026-10-16 — Engineer implements issue #11 (commits 0604233, 2cfdf95)

- date: 2026-10-16
- task/issue: issue #11 — replace `_docs/rubric.md` with the final 12 criteria verbatim; write the impact report at `_docs/reviews/2026-10-16-final-rubric-impact.md`
- agent role: Software Engineer (subagent; entry appended by Orchestrator per the write-only-.scratch/ role limit)
- model: opencode/space-bunny-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): orchestrator instruction to implement #11 from the filed body as amended by the PM comment, with an explicit state check that the interrupted prior run had committed nothing; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `_docs/rubric.md` (78 insertions, 36 deletions, commit 0604233); `_docs/reviews/2026-10-16-final-rubric-impact.md` (570 insertions, new, commit 2cfdf95); no PROTECTED path touched
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (no TEST_CMD: planning phase, no code exists; whitespace PASS; no test files changed); `git diff --check` clean; Engineer reported a scripted byte comparison of `_docs/rubric.md` line 2 onward against the criteria text in the issue Source section; counted 12 criteria, max points summing 24, "You need 10 points to pass". Not yet QA'd
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human paused the session before QA, having uncommitted their own `AGENTS.md` and `opencode.json` changes; human also stopped the `.scratch/` script approach for GitHub issue data after the PM wrote `dump_issue11.py` and `extract_source.py` in place of `gh --json`/`--jq`, which was a process deviation caused by the orchestrator's role prompts

### 2026-10-17 — Orchestrator resumes issue #11: Engineer handover comment, model record

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 — pick up after the pause; post the Engineer handover; record which tool and model built #11
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human handover prompt (read the issue, latest summary, git state, then stop) and human instruction to run step 1, name the tool/model that built #11, record the model change, run QA in a different tool, and not close #11; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (these entries); GitHub: posted Engineer handover comment 6227197431 on #11
- tool and model history for #11 (as far as the record shows): all #11 work recorded was done in OpenCode, none in Claude Code. The human states the model changed during #11 from Muse Spark 1.3 (`opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`) to Space Bunny (`opencode/space-bunny-free`). Filing #11: not recorded. PM grooming: Space Bunny. First Engineer launch (interrupted, no commits): not recorded. Engineer commits 0604233 and 2cfdf95: Space Bunny. Orchestrator entries and summary (ad04f59): not recorded. Muse Spark 1.3's part in #11: not recorded. The human's commit c8dea47 pinned Muse Spark 1.3 in `opencode.json` after the Engineer work
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make assert-clean` PASS at c8dea47 before QA; `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS at c8dea47 (no TEST_CMD: planning phase, no code exists; whitespace PASS; no test files changed)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human confirmed the Orchestrator role for #11 and required QA in a tool other than the one that built it (OpenCode built it, so QA ran in Claude Code)

### 2026-10-17 — QA checks issue #11 at c8dea47 (PASS)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 — full QA check against the filed body as amended by PM comment 6226692732, at commit c8dea47 (Engineer commits 0604233, 2cfdf95)
- agent role: QA Engineer (Claude Code subagent; entry appended by Orchestrator per the write-only-.scratch/ role limit)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code; the qa-engineer agent sets no model, so it inherits the main session's)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): orchestrator instruction to check #11 per `_docs/agent-kit/team/qa-engineer.md` at c8dea47, carrying the AGENTS.md rule on GitHub issue data; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: none (QA wrote only to `.scratch/`: `qa11_check.py`, `qa-11-comment.md`)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): verdict QA PASS, all criteria PASS, posted as issue comment 6227226075; QA ran `make verify` (PASS WITH WARNINGS, no TEST_CMD) and one `.scratch/` analysis script (byte comparison of `_docs/rubric.md` against the issue Source section and count checks). Orchestrator then ran `make assert-clean` PASS and confirmed HEAD unmoved at c8dea47. QA reported 8 risks outside the criteria (in the comment), none changing the verdict
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; human to read the report and record decisions on the two Decision needed items before #11 is closed

### 2026-10-17 — Engineer corrects #11 report for QA risks (commit ed05530)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 follow-up — fix the six QA risks in `_docs/reviews/2026-10-16-final-rubric-impact.md` (US-12 before/after, E6 row, brief line number, #8 criteria count, §1 Totals deployment claim, GitHub Actions Docker VERIFY: tag, §9 counts) and add the source URL and a final newline to `_docs/rubric.md`
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code subagent; entry appended by Orchestrator)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code). Ran in Claude Code, not OpenCode, because OpenCode was unavailable; the human asked for this
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human instruction listing the corrections, relayed by the Orchestrator; source URL supplied by the human (https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp/blob/main/project/README.md); no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `_docs/reviews/2026-10-16-final-rubric-impact.md`, `_docs/rubric.md` (43 insertions, 22 deletions, commit ed05530); Engineer comment 6227407227 on #11
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (no TEST_CMD: planning phase, no code exists; whitespace PASS; no test files changed); Orchestrator `make assert-clean` PASS at ed05530 before QA
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human supplied the source URL; the finalised date 2026-10-17 on rubric line 1 is left for the human to check against the live page

### 2026-10-17 — QA targeted re-check of #11 corrections at ed05530 (PASS)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 — targeted re-check of the seven correction points only (six report points, rubric line 1 and final newline, scope)
- agent role: QA Engineer (fresh Claude Code subagent, separate from the Engineer's context; entry appended by Orchestrator per the write-only-.scratch/ role limit)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code). Ran in Claude Code, not OpenCode, because OpenCode was unavailable; the human asked for this. Engineer and QA ran in the same tool and model this time, as separate subagents
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): orchestrator instruction to re-check the listed points against the files and `gh`, not the Engineer's comment; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: none (QA wrote only to `.scratch/`: `qa11_recheck.py`, `qa11-recheck-comment.md`)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): verdict QA PASS, all seven points PASS, posted as comment 6227431094; QA ran `make verify` (PASS WITH WARNINGS, no TEST_CMD) and one `.scratch/` script (byte comparison of the US-12 BEFORE block against `_docs/specs.md` lines 90-96 and of rubric lines 2 onward against e0a2470). Orchestrator then ran `make assert-clean` PASS, HEAD unmoved at ed05530. QA reported 4 risks outside these points, none changing the verdict
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet

### 2026-10-17 — Orchestrator relays #11 decisions and applies brief change (commit 111b001)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 decision point — post the human's decisions; apply the approved `_docs/project-brief.md` change from report §7.1
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human decisions of 2026-10-17 (target 24/24 built as Tier A/B/C milestones; all no-longer-scored items kept; scoring path first, then LLM brief, MCP server and n8n; US-12 keeps all three acceptance criteria) and human approval of §7.1 1b plus a CI/CD sentence of the human's wording; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `_docs/project-brief.md` (workflow step 8 "Watch and respond"; Fixed stack CI/CD item expanded to PR tests, auto deploy to dev, manual promotion of the same image to production; 7 insertions, 2 deletions, commit 111b001 with HUMAN_APPROVED=1); GitHub: posted the human's decisions verbatim as relayed Orchestrator comment 6228520087 on #11
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff --check` clean; final diff shown to the human
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human rejected §7.1 1a (MCP server out of the MVP), approved 1b as written, and supplied the CI/CD sentence; human chose to apply all §7 changes before cleanup and closing #11

### 2026-10-17 — Orchestrator applies approved spec and brief changes (commits 701951d, 16e1ec0, b8792b3)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 decision point — apply the approved `_docs/specs.md` changes from report §7.2 and a further brief change; relay the human's hosting decision to #9
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human decisions on §7.2 (reject 2a; accept US-13 and US-14; replace US-15 with the human's text; accept E6 naming Grafana), human edits (Grafana in US-13; US-15 via pull request, CI deploys to dev; open question 5 on the responder's credential and merge; shorten "fixes it with a test"), human's observability-stack sentence for the brief, and the human's hosting decision text for #9; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `_docs/specs.md` (US-13, US-14, US-15, edge case E6, open questions 4 and 5; 32 insertions, commit 701951d; one-line US-15 follow-up, commit 16e1ec0); `_docs/project-brief.md` (Fixed stack adds OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo and Grafana; 3 insertions, 1 deletion, commit b8792b3); all three commits with HUMAN_APPROVED=1. GitHub: posted the human's hosting decision verbatim as relayed Orchestrator comment 6229681999 on #9. `opencode.json` (human's own uncommitted change) left out of all commits at the human's instruction
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff --check` clean before each commit; final diffs shown to the human before each commit (spec diff shown before the last two human edits, which were applied as instructed)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human rejected §7.2 2a (US-12 stays with all three acceptance clauses), rewrote US-15, named Grafana, added open question 5; Orchestrator numbered the US-14 window question 4 because question 3 already existed

### 2026-10-17 — AGENTS.md Layout and "Where to read more" (commit 4075318); issue #12 filed

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 decision point — apply report §7.0 to `AGENTS.md`; file the follow-up issue for `_docs/agent-team.md`
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human chose the Orchestrator's revised version of §7.0 (stale Layout fixed, Claude Code layer named, spec and brief added, `_docs/agent-team.md` left out until written) with the human's "when to read" wording for the spec, process and procedures entries; human asked for an issue to write `_docs/agent-team.md`; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `AGENTS.md` (Layout line updated; "Where to read more" list added; 13 insertions, 1 deletion; drafted by the Orchestrator, diff shown to the human, committed by the human as 4075318 with HUMAN_APPROVED=1). GitHub: filed issue #12 (Write `_docs/agent-team.md` for the Agent Team Specification criterion), not yet groomed by the PM
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): every path in the list checked to exist with `ls` before proposing; final diff shown to the human before commit
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human chose option (a) with edits and ran the commit; the same-tool QA exception in #12's body is the Orchestrator's wording, flagged to the human for correction

### 2026-10-17 — Planning process and README updated for the final rubric (§7.3)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 decision point — apply report §7.3, adjusted to the human's decisions, to `_docs/planning-process.md`; link the impact report from `README.md`
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator's adjusted §7.3 proposal (items 1-4), accepted by the human with additions: Stage 3 file `_docs/api.md` and CI export of the generated OpenAPI document; Docker-capable dev environment and cost controls with teardown in the Stage 2 deployment bullet; deliberate, documented, removable responder defect in Stage 4; Stage 2 checklist line and component list; Stage 6 Reviewer reading list as a statement; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `_docs/planning-process.md` (Stage 2 components, observability and deployment bullets, checklist; Stage 3 API design; Stage 4 telemetry, alerting, responder and CI security scan; Stage 5 milestones; Stage 6 12 criteria and Reviewer list), `README.md` (impact report link); committed together (not protected). `opencode.json` and `.claude/settings.json` (changed outside this work, not read) left out of the commit
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff --check` clean; diff shown to the human before the final three additions, which were applied as instructed
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human accepted items 1-4 and supplied the additions above; human dropped nothing

### 2026-10-17 — AI usage report header updated (§7.5, commit a535ff7)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 decision point — apply report §7.5 to `_docs/ai-usage-report.md`
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human accepted the proposed header (not a scored criterion; kept for portfolio value and as supporting evidence) and the Orchestrator's change to section 2 (summarise and link `_docs/agent-team.md`, issue #12); no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `_docs/ai-usage-report.md` (6 insertions, 4 deletions, commit a535ff7; not protected)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff --check` clean
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human approved both changes before they were made

### 2026-10-17 — Rubric Evidence Auditor regenerates rubric evidence for the 12 final criteria (§7.4, commit ad5b27d)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 decision point — regenerate `_docs/rubric-evidence.md` for the final rubric (report §7.4)
- agent role: Rubric Evidence Auditor (Claude Code subagent; entry appended by Orchestrator, since the Orchestrator limited the auditor to editing `_docs/rubric-evidence.md` only)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code). Ran in Claude Code, not OpenCode, because OpenCode was unavailable; the human asked for this. An OpenCode re-audit is planned after Stage 2
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): orchestrator instruction per the human's spec for the table (criterion, max points, full-marks condition quoted from `_docs/rubric.md`, status, evidence, gap), evidence only from what exists now, §7.4 mapping as a cross-check only; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `_docs/rubric-evidence.md` (12-row table, header with audit date and commit; 43 insertions, 21 deletions; committed by the Orchestrator as ad5b27d)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): audited at a535ff7; 7 of 24 points evidenced (Problem Description PARTIAL 1; Product Specification, Agent Team Specification, Context Management MET 2 each; the other 8 MISSING). Auditor ran `make verify` (PASS WITH WARNINGS, no TEST_CMD) and opened the GitHub evidence with `gh --json/--jq`; no `.scratch/` scripts. Orchestrator checked `git status` showed only that file changed
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Auditor findings for the human: the #11 commits are not pushed, so the public repo (at bd616a5) lacks the evidence for criteria 2-4; `.claude/agents/rubric-auditor.md` still says "14 criteria" and tells the auditor to append to the log (the #10 contradiction); a stray tracked `test.md` at the repo root; the local `origin/main` ref is stale (27d4760 vs remote bd616a5)

### 2026-10-17 — Orchestrator close-out of issue #11

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #11 close-out — clean scratch, session summary, close; plus human-requested housekeeping (fetch, remove `test.md`, #10 scope note, new README issue)
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human instruction to close #11 once `make assert-clean` passes, with an Orchestrator comment linking the decisions comment, and four extra items; no key prompt file in `_docs/prompts/`
- files changed: `_session-summaries/issue-011-final-rubric-impact.md` (updated, commit d013f00); `test.md` removed (0554a9f, human-approved). GitHub: comment 6230949666 on #10 (both rubric-auditor files: 12 criteria, same log-entry rule); filed #13 (README: Problem Description 1 → 2 points); closing Orchestrator comment on #11 linking decisions comment 6228520087; #11 closed. Local `origin/main` refreshed with `git fetch` (27d4760 → bd616a5); nothing pushed
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make assert-clean` PASS at d7f69a9 before close-out; `make clean-scratch` ran; QA PASS at c8dea47 and targeted re-check PASS at ed05530 stand
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human committed their own `opencode.json` fix (d7f69a9) to unblock assert-clean and approved deleting `test.md`

### 2026-10-17 — Engineer implements issue #14 stages A and B (commits 7c12cd4, 6327f01)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #14 stages A (Stage 3 process change) and B (DRAFT Lovable prompt) only, per PM grooming comment 6231923268
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code subagent)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to implement stages A and B as groomed, not C, D or E; no prompts index row (stage C); no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/planning-process.md` (§ Stage 3, one sentence, 3 lines added; 7c12cd4); `_docs/prompts/lovable-frontend.md` (new, Status: DRAFT, prompt 605 words; 6327f01). GitHub: Engineer comment 6232712832 on #14
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=ee0fcfe` PASS WITH WARNINGS (only warning: no TEST_CMD, no code exists); `.scratch/` check of the stage B criteria, including the secrets scan and its refused-case fixture, all PASS. QA not yet run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the draft awaits the human's approval (stage C)

### 2026-10-17 — Engineer revises the issue #14 Lovable prompt for Decision 3 (commit 2cbffa9)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #14 stage B revision, applying the human's Decision 3 (build v1 now as discovery; richer model where unsure)
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code subagent)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction quoting Decision 3 verbatim; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/prompts/lovable-frontend.md` (still Status: DRAFT; header adds the discovery-build line, #3 ASSUMPTION now fixed versions per affected range with a "no fixed version" state, #6 ASSUMPTION now open / risk accepted / fixed / withdrawn with sources; prompt updates dashboard, detail, mock data and tests; prompt 698 words; 2cbffa9)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=ee0fcfe` PASS WITH WARNINGS (only warning: no TEST_CMD, no code exists); updated `.scratch/check_issue14_b.py` (Decision 3 checks added) all PASS. QA not yet run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the draft awaits the human's approval (stage C)

### 2026-10-17 — Orchestrator runs issue #14 grooming and decisions; applies Decision 1 (commits f6add8a, 79b43e4)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #14 (human chose it as next); PM grooming, Engineer stages A and B, human's Decisions 1-3; follow-up #15 filed
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session), launching PM and Engineer subagents
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human: "work on the next issue and follow process.md", then chose #14; Decisions 1-3 and notes given in session (quoted in PM comment 6232771876 on #14)
- files changed: `AGENTS.md` (protected, HUMAN_APPROVED=1; one line allowing a mocked frontend prototype in `frontend/` during planning; f6add8a); `_docs/planning-process.md` (same line, same wording; 79b43e4). GitHub, by PM subagent: grooming comment 6231923268 and approval request 6232722317 and decisions comment 6232771876 on #14; comment 6232771639 on #6; filed #15 (stages D-E)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): human reviewed both diffs before they were applied; QA of stages A and B not yet run (human to run it in a fresh OpenCode session, per the #11 rule that QA doesn't run in the tool that built the work)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): human approved Decision 1 wording and both diffs; accepted the Engineer's three choices (no "stale" status, dashboard status filter, a mock finding with no aliases); prompt approval to follow separately

### 2026-10-17 — Engineer applies the human's three edits to the issue #14 Lovable prompt (commit 67322c9)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #14 stage B revision, the human's three edits before prompt approval (services-layer order with no re-sort and pre-ranked mock data; React with TypeScript and `npm test`; demo credentials on the login screen)
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code subagent)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction quoting the human's three edits verbatim; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/prompts/lovable-frontend.md` (still Status: DRAFT; screen 2 and first test use the human's wording; mock data pre-ranked by the `_docs/planning-process.md` § Stage 2 tie-breaks; Stage 2 header ASSUMPTION updated, including criticality higher first and missing EPSS last, which Stage 2 does not state; prompt 774 words, up from 698, all from these edits; 67322c9). GitHub: Engineer comment 6232991787 on #14
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=ee0fcfe` PASS WITH WARNINGS (only warning: no TEST_CMD, no code exists); updated `.scratch/check_issue14_b.py` (word limit is 698 plus the net words of these edits; new-text checks) all PASS. QA not yet run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the revised draft awaits QA and the human's approval

### 2026-10-17 — Engineer corrects the record for the issue #14 prompt edits (commit 67322c9)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #14, fix for QA FAIL comment 6233025035 (record correction only)
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code subagent)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to correct the record after QA FAIL 6233025035, with the human's decision recorded in Orchestrator comment 6233052344; no key prompt file saved
- correction: the previous entry (commit 67322c9) and Engineer comment 6232991787 said all 76 added words (698 to 774) came from the human's three edits. That was inaccurate. 12 of the 76 words were the Engineer's own sentence, added after the human's demo-credentials line: "They are fictional; if the username is an email, it uses example.com." QA FAIL comment 6233025035 found this. The human accepted the sentence as part of edit 3 and waived the 700-word limit for this prompt, so 774 words stands (Orchestrator comment 6233052344)
- files changed: `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry only; the earlier entry is left as written). `_docs/prompts/lovable-frontend.md` not changed. GitHub: new Engineer comment on #14 with the same correction
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=ee0fcfe` run after this commit; result reported in the Engineer comment on #14. QA not yet re-run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human decided to accept the sentence and waive the word limit (comment 6233052344); this entry itself not yet reviewed

### 2026-10-17 — Engineer marks the issue #14 Lovable prompt APPROVED and indexes it (commit efa250d)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #14 stage C (approval and index entry)
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code subagent)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction quoting the human's approval given in session: "I looked at the prompt and approve it, date approval today." Prompt file: `_docs/prompts/lovable-frontend.md`
- files changed: `_docs/prompts/lovable-frontend.md` (line 1 only, `Status: DRAFT` to `Status: APPROVED (human, 2026-10-17)`); `_docs/prompts/README.md` (one index row; "where executed" says Lovable, run by the human, not yet run, since the build is in #15 per Decision 2); efa250d, an amend of unpushed 7ba1140 that corrected the row's issue number from "stage D of #14" to #15. GitHub: Engineer comment on #14
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=ee0fcfe` PASS WITH WARNINGS (only warning: no TEST_CMD, no code exists); `git diff --stat` showed 2 files, 2 insertions, 1 deletion; `git log --follow` on the prompt lists 6327f01, 2cbffa9, 67322c9, 7ba1140 (re-run after the amend gives efa250d in its place). Decision 3 (approve before #3, #4, #6) was answered by the human, as recorded in PM comment 6232771876. QA of stage C not yet run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the prompt text; this commit not yet reviewed

### 2026-10-17 — PM re-grooms issue #15 for the Bolt build; issue parked

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #15, lifecycle step 2 (grooming), after the human's commit fea6fb7 added a Bolt-built frontend in `frontend-bolt/`
- agent role: PM (Claude Code subagent), launched by the Orchestrator
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to re-groom #15 for the Bolt build, read-only on `frontend-bolt/`, no npm runs; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo (drafts in `.scratch/` only). GitHub: PM comments 6234073282 (re-grooming, three decision questions) and 6234079369 (marks Bolt as settled, quoting the human); Orchestrator comment 6234114564 (the human's answers; issue parked)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none; the PM read `frontend-bolt/` and grepped it, with nothing run or installed. Issue body not edited
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human explained the switch to Bolt ("I tried to build in lovable but hit a credit limit. I tried the same prompt in Bolt..."), confirmed the prompt was pasted verbatim with no follow-ups, kept `.bolt/` for now, and deferred the other decisions until the Lovable credits reset

### 2026-10-17 — PM grooms issue #12 (agent-team document)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #12, lifecycle step 2 (grooming)
- agent role: PM (Claude Code subagent), launched by the Orchestrator
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to groom #12 per `task-template.md`; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo. GitHub: PM comments 6234146060 (proposed body, two decision questions) and 6234208915 (the human's answers). The issue body was replaced with the groomed body (`gh issue edit 12`): the tool blocked the PM's run, and the Orchestrator ran the command after the human typed it in session
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): body length checked after the edit (9086 characters, against 1581 before)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose option 1 for both decisions (the PM's wording for the QA same-tool exception; intent plus record for tool and model)

### 2026-10-17 — Engineer implements issue #12 (commit ede47bf)

- date: 2026-10-17
- task/issue: issue #12, lifecycle step 3: write `_docs/agent-team.md` and link it from `README.md`; propose the `AGENTS.md` line
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Engineer, as its role file says while #10 is open)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to implement the groomed #12 body with the human's answers in PM comment 6234208915 (option 1 for both decisions), base ccd13b6, and to return the `AGENTS.md` diff for approval rather than commit it; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/agent-team.md` (new), `README.md` (one link line); 116 insertions, commit ede47bf. `AGENTS.md` not edited; the one-line diff is proposed in Engineer comment 6234459590 on #12
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=ccd13b6` PASS WITH WARNINGS (only warning: no TEST_CMD, no code exists; whitespace PASS; no test files changed); `.scratch/check_issue12.py` (relative links and anchors, 15 commits via `git cat-file -e`, cited issues and comment ids via `gh issue view --json`, verbatim exception and intent text, model ids, refused cases) PASS. QA not yet run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet

### 2026-10-18 — Orchestrator commits the approved AGENTS.md line for issue #12 (commit 948e332)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #12, protected-file change
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's in-session answer "Approve as written" to the line proposed in Engineer comment 6234459590; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `AGENTS.md` (one line in "Where to read more"), committed on its own with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` as 948e332. GitHub: Orchestrator comment 6243691600 records the approval and the human's choice of QA tool
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff` showed the approved line only; `git diff --check` clean. QA checked it afterwards (next entry)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the exact line in session

### 2026-10-18 — QA checks issue #12 (PASS at 948e332)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #12, lifecycle step 4
- agent role: QA Engineer (fresh Claude Code qa-engineer subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Orchestrator after `make assert-clean`, as the QA role file says)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code). It ran in Claude Code, the same tool as the build, because OpenCode is unavailable and the human chose this (comment 6243691600), under the exception in comment 6234208915
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to check every #12 criterion independently at 948e332, base ccd13b6; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo (`.scratch/qa12_check.py`, `.scratch/qa12_hook_test.sh` and `.scratch/qa12-comment.md` only). GitHub: QA comment 6243727864
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS, all 21 criteria. `make verify BASE=ccd13b6` PASS WITH WARNINGS (only warning: no TEST_CMD); QA's own link, commit, issue, quote and refused-case checks; a hook test in a throwaway repo under `.scratch/` (unapproved `AGENTS.md` staging refused, `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` allowed). The guard hook blocked one `git config core.hooksPath`; QA re-ran it as `git config --get core.hooksPath` (result `.githooks`). After QA, `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD unchanged at 948e332
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; QA's risks go to the human at the decision point

### 2026-10-18 — Engineer fixes `_docs/agent-team.md` after the #12 decision point (commit 32ed2a3)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #12, lifecycle step 7 back to step 3: apply the human's decision-point answers (Orchestrator comment 6243801494) to `_docs/agent-team.md`
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Engineer, as its role file says while #10 is open)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction listing the human's four decisions (role "not recorded" where the log says so; `CLAUDE.md` claims match `6541893`; add the #12 Engineer and QA runs, QA under the same-tool exception; settings text consistent with the new `AGENTS.md` rule) and "Don't change anything else"; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/agent-team.md` (history table gains a "not recorded" role row for the 2026-10-12 entries and `c631603`; #12 Engineer and QA added; third recorded exception use; handover bullets on `CLAUDE.md` and tracked settings files; 10 insertions, 9 deletions, commit 32ed2a3). GitHub: Engineer comment 6243814434 on #12
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=ccd13b6` PASS WITH WARNINGS (only warning: no TEST_CMD, no code exists; whitespace PASS; no test files changed); `git diff --check` clean. QA re-check not yet run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet

### 2026-10-18 — Orchestrator commits the approved settings and scratchpad change at the issue #12 decision point (commit 6541893)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #12, lifecycle step 7 (decision point), protected-file change
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's in-session answers, recorded in Orchestrator comment 6243801494: the tracked-settings rule in the human's wording (only the missing spaces from line wrapping fixed, and backticks added); the scratchpad line moved from `CLAUDE.md` into `AGENTS.md`; "Approve as shown" for the exact diff
- files changed: `AGENTS.md` (scratch-files line extended; tracked-settings rule added; home-folder and environment-variables rule kept), `CLAUDE.md` (now only `@AGENTS.md`); committed with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` as 6541893
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff` reviewed against the approved diff; `git diff --check` clean. QA re-check PASS (next entry)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the exact diff in session

### 2026-10-18 — QA re-checks the issue #12 decision-point changes (PASS at 92d9926)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #12, lifecycle step 7: QA re-checks only what changed (6541893, 32ed2a3, 92d9926)
- agent role: QA Engineer (fresh Claude Code qa-engineer subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Orchestrator after `make assert-clean`)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code). It ran in Claude Code, the same tool as the build, because OpenCode is unavailable and the human chose this (comment 6243691600), under the exception in comment 6234208915
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to re-check the three commits against comments 6243801494 and 6243814434, and to re-confirm file scope over ccd13b6..HEAD; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo (`.scratch/qa12_recheck.py` and `.scratch/qa12-recheck-comment.md` only). GitHub: QA comment 6243839013
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS. `python3 .scratch/qa12_recheck.py`: 19 checks, 0 failed. `make verify BASE=ccd13b6` PASS WITH WARNINGS (only warning: no TEST_CMD). Scope note: `CLAUDE.md`, and the second `AGENTS.md` change, fall outside the criterion's file list; both come from the human-approved 6541893. After QA, `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD unchanged at 92d9926
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet

### 2026-10-18 — PM files four follow-up issues from #12 (#16 to #19)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: #12 follow-ups (lifecycle step 7). After #12 closed, the human asked for the QA risks to be filed as future issues. This replaces "none selected" in Orchestrator comment 6243801494 and in the #12 session summary
- agent role: PM (Claude Code subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Orchestrator)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to file one ungroomed issue per risk; no key prompt file saved. A first PM run stopped when the session ended, before filing anything (checked: no new issues or comments, clean tree); a fresh PM run did the task
- files changed: none in the repo. GitHub: #16 (agent-team.md history table upkeep), #17 (`_docs/agent-kit/scripts/check-staged.sh` doesn't enforce "committed alone"; a protected path), #18 (record approvals as exact text), #19 (`_docs/ai-usage-report.md` §2 TODO)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the PM checked open issues #3-#10, #13 and #15 for duplicates and found none. Not groomed yet
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet

### 2026-10-18 — Orchestrator compares the Bolt and Lovable prototypes (#15)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #15. The human asked for both prototypes (`frontend-bolt/` at fea6fb7, `frontend-lovable/` at 0dd108a) to be reviewed, one chosen and renamed `frontend/`, and follow-up issues drafted for course steps 3-6
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's in-session request; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/reviews/2026-10-18-frontend-comparison.md` (51b477a). GitHub: Orchestrator comment 6244151098 on #15 recording the human's four decisions (Lovable chosen; `frontend-bolt/` deleted in its own commit; F0-F6 filed with F4-F6 gated on the phase line; `openapi.yaml` as contract plus a FastAPI conformance test)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): static read only. Node.js and npm are not installed (`node --version`: command not found), so neither app was installed, built or tested. Read-only greps: every email in both `src/` trees uses example.com/.org/.net; network-call grep hits recorded in the review
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose the recommended option on all four decisions

### 2026-10-18 — PM re-grooms #15 for Lovable and files #20-#26

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #15 (lifecycle step 2, re-grooming) and follow-ups F0-F6 from the 2026-10-18 frontend comparison
- agent role: PM (Claude Code pm subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Orchestrator)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to re-groom #15 per the human's decisions and file F0-F6; the human's stage D values relayed during the run ("build completition date 18-10-2026. total credits used is 6. no follow up prompts used, only the resume function"); no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo. GitHub: #15 body and title rewritten (stage D run record; stage E split into E1, no Node needed, and E2, after #20), PM comment 6244224555; new issues #20 (dev container Node and uv), #21 (frontend clean-up), #22 (services layer ready for a real API), #23 (API contract), #24 (FastAPI in-memory backend), #25 (connect frontend and backend), #26 (SQLAlchemy persistence). #24-#26 are blocked until the human changes the AGENTS.md "Current phase" line
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none; the issues are not yet implemented
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet

### 2026-10-18 — Engineer records the frontend runs and moves Lovable to frontend/ (#15 stage D and part E1)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #15, stage D (run record) and part E1 (move, delete, scan, document). Part E2 not started: Node.js is not installed and E2 waits for #20
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code software-engineer subagent, launched by the Orchestrator)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to implement #15 stage D and E1 only; no key prompt file saved
- run facts recorded (from the human, relayed by the Orchestrator; the agent never used either tool): the prompt was `_docs/prompts/lovable-frontend.md` `## Prompt`, pasted verbatim into both tools. Lovable first attempt 2026-10-17 stopped at the credit limit. Bolt, 2026-10-17: no follow-up prompts, credits not recorded, project https://bolt.new/~/sb1-fvxy4uq3, committed by the human in fea6fb7 under `frontend-bolt/` (compared, not chosen). Lovable, build completed 2026-10-18: 6 credits in total, no follow-up prompts (continued with Lovable's resume function), project https://lovable.dev/projects/f9cb1f93-46d1-4d9b-baa6-4e09b65a57f3, committed by the human in 0dd108a under `frontend-lovable/` (chosen)
- files changed: b566fb6 (`git mv frontend-lovable frontend`, 94 renames at 100%); cbe2123 (`git rm -r frontend-bolt`, 37 deletions, human-approved decision 2; code stays at fea6fb7); 73a70af (`frontend/.gitignore`: `.env`, `.env.*`, `!.env.example`); 4a9f328 (`_docs/prompts/lovable-frontend.md` run record and follow-ups line, `_docs/prompts/README.md` "Used with" row, `frontend/README.md` Services layer section); this entry. GitHub: Engineer comment on #15
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `.scratch/issue15_scan.py` over the 94 files in `git ls-files frontend`: 1 hit, the fictional demo password `triage-demo` (harmless); fixture `.scratch/issue15_fixture.txt` flagged all 3 lines. `.scratch/issue15_prompt_check.py`: Status line and `## Prompt` section identical to 0dd108a. Network and backend-key greps run. `make verify`: FAIL on "test files deleted" (2 renamed Lovable tests, a false positive of the gate's `--no-renames` diff, and 4 Bolt tests in the approved deletion); referred to the human. No tests run: no Node.js
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet

### 2026-10-18 — Orchestrator and PM act on the human's #15 install, Stage 3, n8n/MCP and spec answers

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #15 follow-ups (the human's answers to the PM's three questions and spec note)
- agent role: Orchestrator (Claude Code main session) and PM (Claude Code pm subagent, resumed; entry appended by the Orchestrator)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's in-session answers: E2 first install with `npm install --before=2026-10-18`; the Stage 3 wording in the human's own text (only the spaces lost to line wrapping restored), recorded on #11 as a change to its decision 2; file the n8n/MCP contract issue; add the owner assumption to `specs.md`
- files changed: `_docs/specs.md` (one Assumptions line, d3a8f11, `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`). GitHub: Orchestrator comment 6244293385 on #11; PM: #15 body (E2 install criterion), comment 6244314164; #23 body (approved Stage 3 text, human review of `openapi.yaml`), comment 6244314486; new issue #27 (n8n and MCP server endpoints, depends on #23)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff` of the `specs.md` change matched the approved line; `git diff --check` clean
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the `specs.md` line and the Stage 3 text in session

### 2026-10-18 — Engineer fixes the weakened-tests check for renames and approved deletions (#28)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #28 (verify gate: test-file renames count as moves; `APPROVED_TEST_DELETIONS` in `agent-kit.conf`)
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code software-engineer subagent, launched by the Orchestrator)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to implement #28, run the fixture script and `make verify BASE=0dd108a`, and return the protected diff with an approval request before committing; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/agent-kit/scripts/verify.sh` (rename-aware `-M` diff, R100 moves skipped, edited renames diffed old to new, exact-path approved deletions, glob entries fail) and `agent-kit.conf` (`APPROVED_TEST_DELETIONS` with the four `frontend-bolt/` test paths), both protected, committed alone in 035eafd with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` (`git show --stat --format= 035eafd` lists only those two files); `lib.sh` unchanged; this entry; `_session-summaries/issue-028-verify-renames.md`. GitHub: Engineer comment on #28
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `.scratch/issue-28-verify-fixtures.sh`: 24 passed, 0 failed (throwaway repos under `.scratch/issue-28-fixtures/`; this repository's HEAD and `git status --short` the same before and after). `make verify BASE=0dd108a` (uncommitted changes): weakened-tests section lists the four Bolt paths under "Deleted with approval", no deletion FAIL; result PASS WITH WARNINGS (only the no-TEST_CMD warning); same result after 035eafd. No QA yet
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the exact diff of `verify.sh` and `agent-kit.conf` in session, 2026-10-18 ("Approve as shown (Recommended)", relayed by the Orchestrator, who checked the working-tree diff matched)

### 2026-10-18 — QA checks #28 (PASS at d32840c); decision point; #15 stage D/E1 QA (FAIL on commit scope)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #28, lifecycle steps 4-7; issue #15, stage D and part E1, lifecycle step 4
- agent role: QA Engineer (two fresh Claude Code qa-engineer subagents, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Orchestrator after `make assert-clean`) and Orchestrator (decision point)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instructions to check #28 against its criteria with QA's own fixtures, and #15 stage D and E1 (E2 listed as not yet checked); no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo (QA scripts in `.scratch/` only). GitHub: QA PASS on #28 (comment 6246783716); QA FAIL on #15 D/E1 (comment 6246840624); Orchestrator decision comments 6247718969 (#28) and 6247719173 (#15)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): #28: QA's `.scratch/qa-28-checks.sh` passed all 27 criteria checks; the Engineer's fixture script passed 24/24; `make verify BASE=0dd108a` PASS WITH WARNINGS (no TEST_CMD only). #15: every D/E1 check passed except E1 (c): `git log --grep="#15"` also matched d3a8f11 (`specs.md`, human-approved), which is outside the allowed paths. After each QA run, `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD unchanged at d32840c
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human decided QA's risks: #28 risks 1 and 2 to be filed as follow-ups, risk 3 not filed ("bolt was not used"), with a note on #21; #15 E1 (c) to list commits explicitly, "(private)" markings added to #15, and the Lovable project "not linked" to this repo

### 2026-10-18 — Engineer marks the #15 project links "(private)" (new stage D criterion)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #15, stage D, the new "(private)" criterion (Orchestrator decision comment 6247719173, decision 2; PM comment 6247739573). This entry adds to the d85632b entry, which is not edited
- agent role: Software Engineer (Claude Code software-engineer subagent, launched by the Orchestrator)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to mark the links, replace the VERIFY line with the human's answer, and list every #15 Engineer commit for E1 (c); no key prompt file saved
- files changed: 26b8757 (`_docs/prompts/lovable-frontend.md`: "(private)" on the Bolt and Lovable link lines, the run record's VERIFY line replaced with the human's answer "both are private on gh" from comment 6246359512; `frontend/README.md`: "(private)" on the Lovable link line); this entry. GitHub: Engineer comment on #15
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `grep -nE "bolt\.new/|lovable\.dev/projects/|VERIFY"` on both files lists 3 link lines, each with "(private)", and no VERIFY line. `.scratch/issue15_prompt_check.py`: Status line and `## Prompt` section identical to 0dd108a. `make verify BASE=0dd108a` result is in the Engineer comment
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet

### 2026-10-18 — QA re-checks #15 stage D / part E1 (PASS at 3abcc65)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #15, stage D and part E1, lifecycle step 4 re-check of what changed after QA FAIL 6246840624
- agent role: QA Engineer (fresh Claude Code qa-engineer subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Orchestrator after `make assert-clean`)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to re-check only the reworded E1 (c), the new "(private)" criterion, the prompt byte-check and `make verify`; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo (`.scratch/qa15_recheck.py` and its comment body only). GitHub: QA PASS comment 6247797817
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS for D/E1. All seven listed #15 Engineer commits touch only allowed paths; 3 link lines carry "(private)" and no VERIFY line is left; the usage log diff since d85632b removes no line; `## Prompt` byte-identical to 0dd108a; `make verify BASE=0dd108a` PASS WITH WARNINGS (no TEST_CMD only). E2 not yet checked (waits for #20). QA reported running one inline `python3 -c "print(1)"`, against the AGENTS.md rule; it changed nothing. After QA, `make assert-clean` PASS, HEAD unchanged at 3abcc65
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet

### 2026-10-18 — PM grooms issue #20 (dev container Node.js + uv)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #20 — first grooming; pin the open Node/uv values, correct the stale feature id, close the lockfile question, add refused cases
- agent role: PM (Product Manager subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Orchestrator per the write-only-`.scratch/` role limit)
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to groom #20 per `_docs/agent-kit/team/pm.md`; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo (drafts in `.scratch/`). GitHub: PM grooming comment 6247960494; #20 body edited to the groomed text; PM decisions comment 6248923707; filed follow-up #31 (Docker/Compose), linked from #20 out-of-scope
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none (no code changed). PM read `frontend/package.json` (vite 8.1.5), the devcontainers/features node feature, nodejs/Release schedule and PyPI/uv metadata to pin the values
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human answered the four grooming decisions (Node `24.22.0`; uv via `pipx install uv==0.13.1`; file #31; apply the body edits as drafted)

### 2026-10-18 — Engineer implements #20 (uncommitted, held for the human's gated commit)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #20 — add pinned Node.js (`ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:2` at `24.22.0`, `pnpmVersion: none`), remove the duplicate `remoteEnv.PATH`, and add `pipx install uv==0.13.1`
- agent role: Software Engineer (opencode software-engineer subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Orchestrator per the write-only-`.scratch/` role limit)
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to implement #20 from the groomed body, not rebuild, and return the diff and approval request; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and `.devcontainer/setup.sh` in the working tree only — UNCOMMITTED, because the pre-commit hook gates any `.devcontainer/` change behind `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`; the Engineer stopped and returned the approval request. `.scratch/issue-20-check.py`, `.scratch/issue-20-tooling.sh`, `.scratch/issue-20-pipx-writable.py` (git-ignored). Proposed (not edited) AGENTS.md Environment line. This entry and `_session-summaries/issue-020-node-uv-devcontainer.md`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=HEAD` PASS WITH WARNINGS (only the no-`TEST_CMD` warning; project in planning, no code); `.scratch/issue-20-check.py` all static criteria PASS including the refused-case patterns. Runtime `node`/`npm`/`uv` not run (no Node or uv in this container; deferred to QA after the human rebuilds). `.devcontainer/devcontainer-lock.json` not regenerated (no devcontainer CLI here); raised as a decision question
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose to run the `.devcontainer/` commit commands themselves and chose lockfile option 1 with checks (show the regenerated-lock diff after the rebuild; only new feature entries; `github-cli` unchanged; if not updated, stop). The commit and rebuild are pending

### 2026-10-18 — Add `make tool-versions` target and document it (human instruction, no issue)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: add a `make tool-versions` target that prints the version of node, npm, uv, python3 and docker (or `<tool>: missing`), and add it to the AGENTS.md Commands section (human instruction, no issue)
- agent role: Orchestrator
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human instruction in-session ("Add a `tool-versions` target to the Makefile's project section (protected; show me the diff) that prints the version of node, npm, uv, python3 and docker, or \"<tool>: missing\" ... Add it to AGENTS.md's Commands section."); no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `Makefile` (new `tool-versions` target with `##` help text, in the project section; 3 insertions); `AGENTS.md` (Commands line "Tool versions:"; the whole file was committed, carrying the human's pre-existing uncommitted Project-rules additions); this entry
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make tool-versions` printed `node: missing`, `npm: missing`, `uv: missing`, `python3: Python 3.12.15`, `docker: missing`; `make help` lists `tool-versions`; `git diff --check` clean
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved committing `Makefile` and `AGENTS.md` with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`, including the pre-existing AGENTS.md Project-rules edits

### 2026-10-18 — Engineer runs the post-rebuild runtime checks and Verify for #20 (lifecycle step 3)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #20, lifecycle step 3 continued after the human rebuilt the container: the post-rebuild runtime checks (`node`/`npm`/`uv --version` exit 0, and the non-interactive `make`-shell criterion), run Verify, and post the Engineer comment
- agent role: Software Engineer (opencode software-engineer subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Engineer, as its role file says)
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to run the runtime checks the post-rebuild criteria need, run Verify with the appropriate BASE, post the Engineer `:` comment on #20, and append this entry; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `.scratch/issue-020-runtime-check.sh` (git-ignored; read-only checks, no installs and no network); this entry. No repo file other than this entry changed. GitHub: Engineer comment 6249655264 on #20 (body drafted in `.scratch/issue-020-engineer-comment.md`)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=dc843de` (the issue's own commits 4eb0485 and f3ed87d; 4 files, 35 insertions, 14 deletions) PASS WITH WARNINGS, and `make verify` (default, since `origin/main`) PASS WITH WARNINGS; the only warning in each is the no-`TEST_CMD` one (planning phase, no code exists; whitespace PASS; no test files changed). `.scratch/issue-020-runtime-check.sh` every check exit 0: `node --version` v24.22.0, `npm --version` 11.19.1, `uv --version` uv 0.13.1 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu); the same three in a non-interactive `sh -c`; `command -v` resolves node/npm to `/usr/local/share/nvm/versions/node/v24.22.0/bin/` and uv to `/usr/local/py-utils/bin/uv`; `make tool-versions` exit 0. Finding reported to the human: commit 4eb0485 also changes `opencode.json` (not in #20's Constraints). QA not run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the report raises two items for the human — the `opencode.json` change bundled into 4eb0485 (outside #20's Constraints, protected file, not touched) and the proposed AGENTS.md Environment line, which is not edited

### 2026-10-18 — QA checks #20 (PASS at abaed5d)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #20 (dev container Node.js and uv), lifecycle step 4
- agent role: QA Engineer (fresh opencode qa-engineer subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Orchestrator after `make assert-clean` per the role's write-only-`.scratch/` limit)
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to check every criterion in #20 against the rebuilt container and the committed diff (`git diff dc843de..HEAD -- .devcontainer` for the refused cases), run `node`/`npm`/`uv --version` and the non-interactive `make`-shell check, run Verify itself, and post a `QA:` verdict; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo (`.scratch/issue-020-qa-check.py` and `.scratch/qa-comment-20.md` only). GitHub: QA PASS comment 6249711806
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS, all nine criteria. `node --version` v24.22.0, `npm --version` 11.19.1, `uv --version` uv 0.13.1; both `sh -c` and `make tool-versions` resolve all three; `remoteEnv` has exactly one `PATH` with all three segments; `git diff dc843de..HEAD -- .devcontainer` shows no refused pattern; the lockfile adds one `node:2` entry and leaves `github-cli:1` byte-identical. The AGENTS.md Environment criterion was treated as PASS (deferred): the issue words it as a protected `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` commit applied at the post-PASS decision point, so QA checked the Engineer's proposed text. `make verify BASE=dc843de` and `make verify` both PASS WITH WARNINGS (only the no-`TEST_CMD` warning). After QA, `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD unchanged at abaed5d
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; risks outside the criteria reported for the decision point — the `opencode.json` change bundled into 4eb0485 (protected, outside #20's Constraints) and the #20 session summary committed at 4bfa89c before QA PASS (candid, no false completion claim)

### 2026-10-18 — Engineer implements #15 stage E2 (install, run, test; protected targets proposed)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #15, stage E2 (install, run, test), lifecycle step 3, after #20 closed
- agent role: Software Engineer (opencode software-engineer subagent, launched by the Orchestrator; entry appended by the Engineer, as its role file says)
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to work the "E2. Install, run, test" and Constraints sections exactly; run `node`/`npm --version`, run `npm install --before=2026-10-18` in `frontend/` (pre-approved), add and verify the make targets, re-run the E1 scan, run Verify, commit non-protected changes only, and post an `Engineer:` comment; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `frontend/package-lock.json` (new, 9130 insertions) committed in 71e5103; `frontend/README.md` ("Make targets" section and dev-server host/port; Services layer untouched) committed in 99781ee; this entry. Protected `Makefile` (frontend-install/start/stop/test plus the all-tests `test` target), `agent-kit.conf` (`TEST_CMD="make test"`) and `AGENTS.md` (Install/Run/Test/Verify lines) edited in the working tree only — NOT committed; their exact diffs are in the Engineer comment on #15. Git-ignored: `.scratch/issue15-e2-smoke.py`, `.scratch/issue15-e2-engineer-comment.md`. GitHub: Engineer comment on #15
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `node --version` v24.22.0, `npm --version` 11.19.1. `npm install --before=2026-10-18` exit 0 (523 packages; `--before` accepted as written, no fallback). `git diff 0dd108a:frontend-lovable/package.json HEAD:frontend/package.json` prints nothing. `make frontend-install` (`npm ci`) exit 0; `make frontend-test` and `make test` exit 0 with 2 files / 10 tests passed; `.scratch/issue15-e2-smoke.py` `/login` and `/` both HTTP 200 with no backend; `make frontend-stop` stopped only the recorded PID and with no PID file printed "frontend is not running" and stopped nothing; no vite process left (`pgrep -af vite`). E1 scan `.scratch/issue15_scan.py` over 95 committed `frontend/` files: 1 hit, the fictional demo password `triage-demo` at `mockData.ts:3` (harmless; the fixture with `owner@gmail.com`, `ghp_`+36, `sk-`+32 is flagged). `make verify` (default, since origin/main; with the working-tree `TEST_CMD`) PASS, no warnings: tests 10/10, whitespace PASS, weakened tests none (the four `frontend-bolt/` paths are the approved E1 deletions). QA not run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the decision point covers the three protected diffs and the choices named in the comment (all-tests target named `test`; `npm --prefix frontend test`; direct Vite binary with explicit `--host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173`; port 5173; the extra Verify-line update)

### 2026-10-18 — QA checks #15 stage E2 (first run PASS discarded; clean re-run PASS at 352ff95)

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #15, stage E2 (install, run, test), lifecycle steps 4-5, two runs
- agent role: QA Engineer (two fresh opencode qa-engineer subagents, launched by the Orchestrator; entries appended by the Orchestrator after `make assert-clean` per the role's write-only-`.scratch/` limit) and Orchestrator (`opencode.json` decision)
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to check the E2 criteria and Constraints at `e3de014`, then (after the tree was dirtied) a second instruction to re-check at `352ff95` with the tree kept clean; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo by QA (`.scratch/` scripts only). GitHub: QA PASS comments 6250209261 (first run, discarded) and 6250305366 (kept re-run). `opencode.json` (protected) gained two allow rules (`git ls-files*`, `pgrep *`) during the first run — the tool persisted them; the human approved keeping them and they were committed as `352ff95` with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): first run QA PASS at `e3de014` (10/10 tests, `/login` HTTP 200 on `127.0.0.1:5173`, secrets scan clean), but `make assert-clean` then FAILED on ` M opencode.json`, so the verdict was discarded per process step 5. Re-run at `352ff95`: QA PASS, all E2 criteria — node v24.22.0, npm 11.19.1, `make frontend-install` (`npm ci`) exit 0, `make frontend-test` and `make test` 10/10, `frontend-start` recorded PID 47104 and `frontend-stop` stopped only it, `/login` and `/` HTTP 200 on port 5173 with no backend, `package.json` unchanged since `0dd108a`, 95-file secrets scan clean and its fixture flagged, no path outside the allowed list for any #15 commit (`352ff95` is the unrelated opencode.json commit). `make verify` and `make verify BASE=0dd108a` both PASS, no warnings. After the re-run `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD unchanged at `352ff95`
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose "Keep and commit" for the two `opencode.json` allow rules (they were the tool persisting an approved read-only check); committed with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` as `352ff95`

### 2026-10-18 — #15 E2 decision point, follow-up comment, and close

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issue #15, lifecycle steps 7-9 (decision point, cleanup and summary, close)
- agent role: Orchestrator; Software Engineer (one follow-up comment)
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human decisions at the E2 decision point (post the Engineer follow-up comment naming the remaining E2 commits; then update the summary, clean up and close); no key prompt file saved
- files changed: this entry; `_session-summaries/issue-015-frontend-choice.md` (updated for E2). GitHub: Engineer follow-up comment 6250367523 naming `c95643b` and `e3de014` (and noting `352ff95` is the unrelated `opencode.json` commit). No code changed
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS at `352ff95` stands; `make assert-clean` PASS; `make clean-scratch` run (`.scratch/` emptied; no process was running)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose to post the Engineer follow-up comment (recommended) rather than accept QA's judgement on the strict E1(c) reading

### 2026-10-18 — Independent review of OpenCode's work on #20 and #15 stage E2

- date: 2026-10-18
- task/issue: issues #20 and #15 (stage E2 and close-out), independent review at HEAD `ac06c02`
- agent role: Reviewer (independent review, asked by the human)
- model: Claude Code, claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's request for an independent review of OpenCode's work on #20 and #15; exact text not recorded
- files changed: `_docs/reviews/2026-10-18-review-issues-15-20.md` (new; committed 2026-10-19 with the entry below)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): no tests run; read the issues, comments, diffs, Makefile, devcontainer recipe, push check, `verify.sh`, log entries and session summaries; checked the built container. Findings: 1 High (the push check will fail: no `install` target, and the `python:3.12` image has no Node), 2 Medium (corepack shims and unpinned nvm in the rebuilt container; QA ran in the build tool with no recorded exception), 4 Low, 8 not-recommended choices, 4 decisions for the human
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the review's four decisions are open. Finding 3 was overtaken by the 2026-10-19 QA rule change (entry below)

### 2026-10-19 — QA independence rule changed

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: no issue; process rule change in `_docs/agent-team.md` § QA independence
- agent role: Orchestrator
- model: Claude Code, claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to replace the QA rule with: "QA always runs in a fresh, isolated context—either in a separate session or via an isolated subagent, never within the context that performed the build. A different tool or model is preferred; when it isn't available, QA proceeds anyway and the QA comment and log entry record which tool and model did the build and the QA."
- files changed: `_docs/agent-team.md` (new rule quoted word for word; the earlier rule, its #12 exception and the three recorded uses kept under "Earlier rule (until 2026-10-19)"; fresh-run and Assert-clean paragraph moved under the new rule); this entry; `_docs/reviews/2026-10-18-review-issues-15-20.md` committed unchanged
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff --check` clean; grep confirmed the rule appears in no role file, `process.md`, `AGENTS.md` or other protected file
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human set the rule wording and approved this commit

### 2026-10-19 — File issue #32 from review errors 1 and 2

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #32 (new), from errors 1 and 2 of `_docs/reviews/2026-10-18-review-issues-15-20.md`
- agent role: Orchestrator
- model: Claude Code, claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked for an issue covering the two errors that the OpenCode agent can work, with priority and order assessed
- files changed: this entry. GitHub: issue #32 created (body edited once to replace an issue-number placeholder with #32). Not groomed; the PM grooms it first
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none; read the push check (`pre-push` lines 23, 29 and 45), the Makefile and `verify.sh` to confirm the facts in the issue
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet

### 2026-10-19 — Implement issue #32 Part A proposal and Part B devcontainer fix

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #32, Part A (push check `install` target and `frontend-test` guard; protected-file diffs proposed) and Part B (pin nvm, remove corepack shims)
- agent role: Software Engineer
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to read `AGENTS.md`, the Engineer role file and issue #32, implement Part A as protected-file diffs (not edits) and Part B with option (b) `corepack disable`, commit only non-protected paths, run `make frontend-install`/`make test`/`make verify`, and post an `Engineer:` comment; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (adds `"nvmVersion": "0.40.8"`) and `.devcontainer/setup.sh` (pins the node bin path and runs `corepack disable`), edited and staged; the commit needs `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` and was left for the orchestrator/human. `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry) and `_session-summaries/issue-032-push-check-and-devcontainer.md`. `Makefile` and `AGENTS.md` (protected) were not edited; their exact proposed diffs are in the `Engineer:` comment on #32. `.devcontainer/devcontainer-lock.json` unchanged. Git-ignored `.scratch/issue-32.json`, `.scratch/issue32-makefile-test/`, `.scratch/proposed-AGENTS.md`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make frontend-install` (`npm ci`) exit 0, 518 packages, `frontend/package-lock.json` unchanged; `make test` 2 files / 10 tests passed; `make verify` PASS, no warnings (tests 10/10, whitespace PASS, weakened tests none; the four `frontend-bolt/` deletions are approved). Scratch guard test with the proposed Makefile and no `frontend/node_modules` printed `frontend/node_modules is missing: run make install first` and exited 1; `grep -E '^install[[:space:]]*::?'` matched the proposed target; `make help` listed `install`; `jq . .devcontainer/devcontainer.json` valid; `bash -n .devcontainer/setup.sh` clean. Current container: the four corepack shims still exist, `corepack --version` 0.36.0, node bin dir `drwxrwsr-x vscode nvm`, `nvm --version` 0.40.8. Post-rebuild checks not run; QA not run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the `.devcontainer/` commit is pending human approval and rebuild, and the protected diffs are pending the Orchestrator's approved commit

### 2026-10-19 — Close out issue #32 after QA PASS and the human's gated push

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #32, lifecycle steps 4-9 (QA, assert-clean, decision point, cleanup and close)
- agent role: Orchestrator; QA engineer (fresh isolated subagent)
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (build and QA; QA ran in a fresh isolated subagent, per the 2026-10-19 QA rule)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's "check issues and continue", then the gate output pasted into the session; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_session-summaries/issue-032-push-check-and-devcontainer.md` (final state); this entry. GitHub: Orchestrator comments 6270008516 and 6271319915; issue #32 closed at the end of this close-out
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS at `eb2e64b`, all Part A and Part B criteria (rebuilt-container checks: no `yarn`/`yarnpkg`/`pnpm`/`pnpx`, nvm `0.40.8`, node `v24.22.0`, npm `11.19.1`, uv `0.13.1`, `make install verify` PASS). `make assert-clean` PASS before the close-out edits and HEAD unchanged at `eb2e64b`. Human gate in the clean clone: `sandbox/main` and HEAD at `eb2e64b`; `node:24.22.0-bookworm` pulled (digest `sha256:14078204b6bb268c107ceff6d3c43f45a888105e5c2b18b14c32b3409d93a1b0`); `command -v bash git make node npm` printed `/usr/bin/bash`, `/usr/bin/git`, `/usr/bin/make`, `/usr/local/bin/node`, `/usr/local/bin/npm`; the gated push ran `make -C . install verify` (npm ci 518 packages, 10/10 tests, whitespace PASS, weakened tests none), printed `VERIFY: PASS`, and pushed `c1896e4..eb2e64b main -> main`. `make verify` after the close-out edits; `make assert-clean` and `make clean-scratch` at close-out
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the protected diffs and the `.devcontainer/` commit, rebuilt the container, set `AGENT_PUSH_CHECK_IMAGE=node:24.22.0-bookworm`, and ran the real gated push

### 2026-10-19 — Groom issue #21 and resolve the `.npmrc` ownership decision

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #21 (grooming only)
- agent role: PM (subagent); Orchestrator relaying the human's decision
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instructions to groom #21 against the task template and to apply the human's option 1 for `frontend/.npmrc`; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none in the repo. GitHub: issue #21 body rewritten twice; PM comments 6270448389 and 6271129779
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): read-only checks only: `git status --short` clean at `eb2e64b`; `make tool-versions` (node `v24.22.0`, npm `11.19.1`, uv `0.13.1`, python3 `3.12.15`, `docker: missing`); `make frontend-test` 2 files / 10 tests passed; a `.scratch/` audit found 46 `frontend/src/components/ui/` files, exactly 4 imported outside that folder, and 10 `it(` tests; Lovable, network and lockfile greps. No product code changed; no implementation
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose option 1: #21 adds `frontend/.npmrc` with `min-release-age=1`; #33 hardening D later appends `ignore-scripts=true`

### 2026-10-19 — Implement issue #21 frontend clean-up

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #21
- agent role: Software Engineer
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to read `AGENTS.md`, the Engineer role file and issue #21, implement the clean-up, gather build evidence for the three render-mode options, propose (not edit) the protected-file diffs, run `make verify` and return the render-mode decision question; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: commits `c816d51` and `e65448e`. Removed `frontend/bun.lock`, `frontend/bunfig.toml`, `frontend/AGENTS.md`, `frontend/.lovable/project.json`, `frontend/src/lib/lovable-error-reporting.ts` and 42 unused `frontend/src/components/ui/*.tsx`; added `frontend/.npmrc` (`min-release-age=1`); rewrote `frontend/vite.config.ts` (explicit plugins, interim render target), `frontend/package.json`, `frontend/package-lock.json` (pruned), `frontend/README.md`, `frontend/src/routes/__root.tsx` (Lovable error reporting, `twitter:site` and Google Fonts links out) and `frontend/src/styles.css` (system font stacks). `Makefile` and `AGENTS.md` were not edited; the proposed `frontend-build` diff is in the `Engineer:` comment. `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry), `_session-summaries/issue-021-frontend-cleanup.md`. Git-ignored `.scratch/audit_frontend.py`, `.scratch/issue-21.json`, `.scratch/issue-21-comment.md`, `.scratch/node-build-{start,stop}.sh`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make frontend-install` (`npm ci`) exit 0 (390 packages, down from 518) and leaves the lockfile unchanged; `npm --prefix frontend config get min-release-age` prints `1`; `make frontend-test` 2 files / 10 tests passed (unchanged baseline); `make verify` PASS (tests 10/10, whitespace PASS, weakened tests none); Lovable refused-case grep has exactly one hit (README provenance); `npm i`/`npm install` grep in README has no hits; network grep hits only `src/services/mockData.ts` and `src/server.ts` (kept while the render mode is undecided). Build evidence: SPA mode (`spa: { enabled: true }` + `preview.host`) builds `dist/client` 548K (shell `_shell.html`) + `dist/server` 196K; nitro `node-server` builds `.output` 2.0M (`server/index.mjs` + `public` 544K) and served the app on `127.0.0.1:3100` (title `Findings — VulnTriage`); plain TanStack Router + Vite builds `dist` 512K with `index.html` (main bundle 305 kB vs 342 kB). All three spike configs and outputs were deleted; `git status --short` clean. QA not run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the render-mode decision, the protected `Makefile` diff and QA are open

### 2026-10-19 — Finalize issue #21 render mode: plain TanStack Router + Vite

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #21 — apply the human's render-mode decision (option 3: plain TanStack Router + Vite, Orchestrator comment 6276301196) on top of `25c9b68`
- agent role: Software Engineer
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to read `AGENTS.md`, the Engineer role file, issue #21 and the human's decision comment, then implement exactly: `tanstackRouter` in `vite.config.ts`, add `frontend/index.html` and `frontend/src/main.tsx`, delete the server files, remove unused dependencies, keep the 10 tests, verify the build serves from `frontend/dist/` and return the final state; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: commit `e367e49`. `frontend/vite.config.ts` (`tanstackStart` → `tanstackRouter({ target: "react", autoCodeSplitting: true })`, other plugins/aliases/dedupe/env/lightningcss/tailwind/tsconfig paths kept); added `frontend/index.html` and `frontend/src/main.tsx`; deleted `frontend/src/server.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/error-capture.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/error-page.ts`, `frontend/src/start.ts`; removed `@tanstack/react-start` and `nitro` from `frontend/package.json` and pruned `frontend/package-lock.json`; `frontend/src/routeTree.gen.ts` regenerated (dropped the `@tanstack/react-start` module augmentation); `frontend/README.md` records the render mode and the `frontend/dist/` output. `frontend/src/routes/__root.tsx` and the route files were not changed. `Makefile`, `AGENTS.md`, `agent-kit.conf` and `opencode.json` not touched. `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry), `_session-summaries/issue-021-frontend-cleanup.md`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `npm --prefix frontend run build` exit 0, writes `frontend/dist/index.html` (963 bytes) and `frontend/dist/assets/` (main bundle `index-Mqk3KKZ8.js` 305233 bytes), git-ignored; `.scratch/serve_check.py` served `frontend/dist` with `python3 -m http.server` on `127.0.0.1:8137` and `GET /` returned HTTP 200 (963 bytes, `#root` present) and the main JS asset returned HTTP 200 (305233 bytes), then it stopped only its own server process; `make install` (`npm ci`) exit 0, 351 packages, lockfile stable across two runs (sha256 unchanged); `make frontend-test` 2 files / 10 tests passed; `make test` 10 passed; `make verify` PASS (tests 10/10, whitespace PASS, weakened tests none). Refused cases re-checked: no `@lovable.dev` in `frontend/src`/`vite.config.ts`/`vitest.config.ts`/`package.json`; `grep -rni lovable frontend` has exactly one hit (README provenance); no `npm i`/`npm install` in `frontend/README.md`; `frontend/.npmrc` is exactly `min-release-age=1` and `npm --prefix frontend config get min-release-age` prints `1`; no dependency added (only the two removed); network grep now hits only `frontend/src/services/mockData.ts` (the `src/server.ts` exception has ended). QA not run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the Orchestrator applies the approved `Makefile` and `AGENTS.md` diffs after this confirmation, then QA runs

### 2026-10-19 — Apply the approved #21 protected changes, run QA and close #21

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #21, lifecycle steps 7-9 (decision point, protected-change commit, QA, cleanup and close)
- agent role: Orchestrator; QA engineer (fresh isolated subagent)
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (build and QA; QA ran isolated, per the 2026-10-19 QA rule)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's decisions — render mode option 3, approve the `Makefile` `frontend-build` target and the one `AGENTS.md` Build line, record the decision on #21, note `frontend/dist/` in `frontend/README.md`, end the session after #21 without starting #22, and do not use `uptime` unless a task requires it; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: commit `682c69f` (protected `Makefile` `frontend-build` target + `.PHONY` entry, and the one `AGENTS.md` Build line; committed alone with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`); this entry; `_session-summaries/issue-021-frontend-cleanup.md` finalized. GitHub: Orchestrator comments 6276301196 (decisions) and the close comment; issue #21 closed
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make frontend-build` exit 0 and writes `frontend/dist/index.html` (963 bytes); `make verify` PASS at `682c69f` (10/10 tests, whitespace PASS, weakened tests none); QA PASS at `682c69f` (all acceptance criteria and refused cases; `frontend/dist` served HTTP 200; the source app rendered in jsdom from login through demo sign-in to findings; protected diff only the approved two files; `agent-kit.conf` unchanged); `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD unchanged at `682c69f`; `make clean-scratch` run. QA risks outside the criteria: `__root.tsx` `shellComponent` renders `<html>` inside `#root` (React hydration warning); the built `index.html` has no stylesheet link (runtime-injected CSS, FOUC without JS); `vite-tsconfig-paths` Vite 8 warning; `package.json` name `tanstack_start_ts`; `682c69f` bundles two protected files in one commit
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the render mode (option 3) and the protected changes, directed that `frontend/README.md` record the `frontend/dist/` path, and asked to end the session after #21 (no #22) and not to use `uptime` again unless a task requires it

### 2026-10-19 — Senior-engineer review of #21 and #32; review #34; file #35

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: review of the opencode work on closed issues #21 and #32; review of follow-up #34; file the push-check plan-mode follow-up (#35)
- agent role: Orchestrator (senior-engineer review at the human's request)
- model: Claude Code / claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked for a senior-engineer review of the opencode agent's work on #21 and #32, scaled down to save usage; then to review the follow-up issues; then approved posting the review and filing the missing follow-up; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: this entry only. GitHub: review comment on #34 (6277799291), new issue #35 ("Push check: plan mode (AGENT_PUSH_CHECK_PLAN=1) completes the push without checking"), link comment on #32 (6277802711). Git-ignored `.scratch/issue-21.json`, `.scratch/issue-32.json`, `.scratch/issue-34-review.md`, `.scratch/issue-prepush-plan.md`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): read-only review; no build, test or `make verify` run. Read the #21 and #32 issue bodies and comments, the #32 diffs (`7207911`, `eb2e64b`), `frontend/src/routes/__root.tsx`, `frontend/index.html` and `frontend/src/main.tsx` at HEAD, and `pre-push` lines 120-140. Verdicts: #32 sound (minor: `setup.sh` repeats the Node version in a hardcoded path); #21 clean-up sound, but the render-mode switch left the Start `shellComponent` (`<html>` inside `#root`) and no stylesheet link in `index.html`, which QA noted and the close-out deferred (now #34). Found `pre-push` plan mode exits 0 after printing the plan, so the push goes through unchecked (now #35). #34 review: six points, mainly the `head()`/`HeadContent` contradiction, the leftover `?url` CSS import, and no check method for the React warning criterion. Permission review: rule deviations in this session were two inline `python3 -I -c` commands (to print issue JSON) and raw `sed`/`tail` reads instead of the read tool; whether any stopped for approval was not recorded
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved posting the #34 review and filing #35

### 2026-10-19 — Check the #21/#32 permission reviews; build the permission review into the agent kit

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: check whether the opencode sessions for #21 and #32 followed the AGENTS.md permission review rule (added in `fbc2a5b`), then make the rule part of the role and close-out steps
- agent role: Orchestrator (review at the human's request)
- model: Claude Code / claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked whether the opencode agent did the permission review, then asked to build it into the process now for long-term efficiency; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: commit `d0884f6` (protected, `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`, approved by the human in this session): `_docs/agent-kit/templates/session-summary.md` (new Permission review section), `_docs/agent-kit/procedures/session-summary.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/process.md` (step 8 bullet, step 9 close condition, definition of done), `_docs/agent-kit/team/pm.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/team/qa-engineer.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/team/software-engineer.md` (a "commands that stopped for approval" line in each role comment). This entry. Git-ignored `.scratch/perm_notes.py` (read-only)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): read-only check with `.scratch/perm_notes.py` over the #21 and #32 issue comments, plus grep of both session summaries. #21: PM and Engineer comments had permission notes; QA and Orchestrator comments did not; the summary section (`eab3ee9`) had the three groups but no settings proposal, and left out the PM's report that `gh issue edit 21` ran without a prompt although `opencode.json:49` sets it to `ask` (cause not found; `.opencode/agents/pm.md` sets no bash rule). #32: no role comment or summary section had a permission review; the session likely started before `fbc2a5b`. The rule appeared nowhere in `_docs/agent-kit/` before `d0884f6`. `git diff --check` clean; `make verify` not run (documentation-only change)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human said the `4895a12` `rg` allow rule was their own change, not the agent's; the human approved the exact protected diff before the commit

### 2026-10-19 — Implement issue #22 services layer

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #22, "Frontend services layer ready for a real API" (groomed; human decisions: services-owned persisted session, idempotent `logout`, two optional owner fields)
- agent role: Software Engineer
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to read `AGENTS.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/team/software-engineer.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/procedures/verify.md`, issue #22 and its PM comment, implement every acceptance criterion and refused case, commit at logical milestones, run `make verify`, post an `Engineer:` comment, and return the commits, verify result, criteria evidence, choices, proposed AGENTS.md changes, spec notes and approval-stopped commands; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: commit `759735a` (14 files): `frontend/src/services/{types,index,mockService,mockData}.ts`; `frontend/src/components/vt/AuditTrail.tsx` (new) and `Badges.tsx`; `frontend/src/routes/{login,_authed,_authed.assets.index,_authed.assets.new,_authed.findings.$findingId,_authed.findings.$findingId_.accept}.tsx`; `frontend/src/test/vulntriage.test.tsx`; `frontend/README.md`. This entry in `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (the issue expected `frontend/**` only; the log is the project rule's record). No `Makefile`, protected file, `package.json` or lockfile change. Git-ignored `.scratch/issue-22.json`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make frontend-test` 2 files / 35 tests passed; `make frontend-build` exit 0 (`frontend/dist/`, git-ignored); `frontend/node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p frontend/tsconfig.json` exit 0 (not a configured project check); `make verify` at `759735a` PASS WITH WARNINGS: tests 35/35, whitespace PASS, weakened tests 7 rewritten assertions, each replaced by a stronger typed assertion (2-arg `acceptRisk`; `ServiceError` code instead of generic throw; non-null `getFinding`; `isOwnerless` instead of `owner === null`; wire value `risk_accepted` instead of `risk accepted`). Refused cases re-checked: no `mockData`/`mockService` import in `routes/`, `components/`, `lib/`; only type-only deep imports of `@/services/...`; no `fetch(`/`axios`/`XMLHttpRequest`/`WebSocket` in `src/services`; `acceptRisk(` has only 2-arg calls; no `owner:` property in `src/`; no dependency added. QA not run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; issue left open for QA. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-19 — Orchestrate issue #22 from grooming to close

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #22, "Frontend services layer ready for a real API" (PM grooming, Engineer implementation, QA check, decision point, cleanup and close)
- agent role: Orchestrator; PM, Software Engineer and QA Engineer (fresh isolated subagents)
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked to check the issues and start #22 following `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`; answered the three grooming decisions (persisted service-owned session, idempotent `logout`, two optional owner fields) and the decision-point questions (approve both spec notes, the 10 → 35 test-count updates, no partial-owner follow-up, keep a session after a failed login). No key prompt file saved
- files changed: commit `9f742d2` (protected `_docs/specs.md`, human-approved, committed alone); commit `c85c6e8` (protected `AGENTS.md` and `agent-kit.conf`, human-approved, committed alone); this entry; `_session-summaries/issue-022-services-layer.md`. GitHub: PM comment 6278909287, Engineer comment 6279079561, QA PASS comment 6279190817, issue #22 closed
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make frontend-test` 35/35; `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS at `759735a` (7 changed-contract assertions rewritten stronger, each justified); QA independently PASS at `f790ddc` for all 34 criteria and refused cases; `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD unchanged at `f790ddc`; `make clean-scratch` run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose the three grooming options and approved the spec and protected test-count changes at the decision point

### 2026-10-19 — Senior review of closed issue #22

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #22, "Frontend services layer ready for a real API" (review after close)
- agent role: Orchestrator (senior engineering review)
- model: Claude Code, claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked for a review of opencode's finished #22 "as a senior engineer who still has a lot more review work this week to complete", then approved posting the follow-ups and this log entry. No key prompt file saved
- files changed: this entry. GitHub: comment on #25 (6279525860: an auth failure shows up as an empty findings/assets list; suggested redirect to `/login`, error states, no retry, one UI test) and on #23 (6279526319: the order in which errors are checked; whether owner fields are always present). Git-ignored `.scratch/issue-22.json`, `.scratch/comment-25.md`, `.scratch/comment-23.md`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): read the diffs of `759735a`, `9f742d2`, `c85c6e8`, the current `frontend/src/services/{types,index,mockService}.ts`, and the PM, Engineer, QA and Orchestrator comments on #22; grep of the list routes' error handling. Verdict: approve, no reopen. Tests and `make verify` not re-run (QA and the orchestrator ran them at `f790ddc`)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved posting both follow-up comments. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-19 — Review opencode's status analysis and record the roadmap

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: no issue; review of opencode's project status and priority analysis, recorded as `_docs/roadmap.md`
- agent role: Orchestrator
- model: Claude Code, claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human pasted opencode's analysis and asked for agreements, disagreements and proposed changes, then asked to record the result as a working plan to review progress against. No key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/roadmap.md` (new), `README.md` (link), this entry
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): checked opencode's claims against `_docs/planning-process.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`, `_docs/rubric.md`, `_docs/rubric-evidence.md`, `agent-kit.conf`, `.github/workflows/verify.yml`, the open issue list, #9, #26, #34 and recent CI runs (`55ad78c` success). Found the scope decision already made (2026-10-17) and the 7-point audit likely stale (Testing 1 and CI/CD 1 unconfirmed). No auditor run; tests not run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human asked for the roadmap; the four open decisions in it are not yet answered. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-19 — Keep deadlines out of the roadmap

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: no issue; follow-up to the roadmap entry above
- agent role: Orchestrator
- model: Claude Code, claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human decided that timelines and dates stay out of agent-facing docs because they can adversely affect the agents; the human controls timing. No key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/roadmap.md` (deadline line replaced by "timing and scope trade-offs are the human's"; the deadline decision row removed), this entry
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff --check` clean; no tests run (docs only)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human declined a proposed deadline edit, then approved this wording. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-19 — Link the roadmap from AGENTS.md

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: no issue; follow-up to the roadmap entries above
- agent role: Orchestrator
- model: Claude Code, claude-opus-5-5
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human approved the proposed one-line addition to `AGENTS.md` "Where to read more". No key prompt file saved
- files changed: protected `AGENTS.md` (commit `2efa508`, committed alone with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`), this entry
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff --check` clean; no tests run (docs only)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the exact line shown in the session before it was written. Commands that stopped for approval: the `HUMAN_APPROVED=1 git commit` (intended)

### 2026-10-19 — Implement issue #13 README problem, functionality and expected behaviour

- date: 2026-10-19
- task/issue: issue #13, "README: describe the problem, functionality and expected behaviour (Problem Description, 1 → 2 points)" (groomed; PM comment made no repo changes and asked whether to file a follow-up for post-implementation README work)
- agent role: Software Engineer
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to read `AGENTS.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/team/software-engineer.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/procedures/verify.md`, issue #13 and its latest PM comment, change only `README.md`, run Verify, commit with explicit paths, and append this entry; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: commit `1a000c2` (`README.md` only): added "The problem", "What VulnTriage does" and "Expected behaviour" sections, an explicit planning/not-implemented note, and expanded OSV.dev, CISA KEV, FIRST EPSS, LLM, MCP and n8n on first use; kept the planning and AI-workflow index. This entry in `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (project rule). Git-ignored `.scratch/issue-13.json`, `.scratch/check_readme_13.py`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` before the log entry (README diff identical to `1a000c2`) PASS WITH WARNINGS: tests 2 files / 35 tests passed, whitespace PASS, weakened tests 7 rewritten assertions that predate this task (issue #22 test changes already in the unpushed range; this task changed no test). `.scratch/check_readme_13.py` PASS: every relative link resolves and all three required headings and fixed names are present. No QA run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; issue left open for QA. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-20 — Close out issue #13

- date: 2026-10-20
- task/issue: issue #13, "README: describe the problem, functionality and expected behaviour (Problem Description, 1 → 2 points)"
- agent role: Orchestrator
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked to check `_docs/roadmap.md` and start the next issue following `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_session-summaries/issue-013-readme-problem-description.md` (new), `_docs/roadmap.md` (step 2 status and check-in line), this entry. Implementation `1a000c2` and the Engineer's log entry `e46fadf` were made by the Engineer
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): PM grooming, Engineer implementation and QA PASS were separate subagent runs. QA ran `make verify BASE=1be4f95` PASS (35 tests, whitespace PASS, no test files changed) and `make assert-clean` PASS at `e46fadf`. The orchestrator re-ran `make assert-clean` and confirmed HEAD stayed `e46fadf`. No auditor run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human answered the decision point: do not file a README follow-up now, and no action on QA's minor findings. The roadmap records that step 2 started ahead of step 1 at the human's request. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-20 — Rubric evidence re-audit (roadmap step 1)

- date: 2026-10-20
- task/issue: roadmap step 1, "Refresh the rubric evidence"; re-audit `_docs/rubric.md` at HEAD `74e9cfc`
- agent role: Rubric Evidence Auditor
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to read `AGENTS.md` and `.opencode/agents/rubric-auditor.md`, re-audit at HEAD `74e9cfc`, confirm Testing 1 (35 cases and passing), CI/CD 1 (`verify.yml` runs the tests on every PR) and Problem Description 2 (README after #13), open every linked file or output, update only `_docs/rubric-evidence.md` and append this entry; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/rubric-evidence.md` (rewritten with the 2026-10-20 audit), this entry. No code or other file changed; not committed (orchestrator reviews and commits)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): opened `_docs/rubric.md`, `README.md` at `74e9cfc`, `_docs/specs.md`, `_docs/agent-team.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `Makefile`, `agent-kit.conf`, `.github/workflows/verify.yml`, both frontend test files, `frontend/src/services/index.ts` and `mockService.ts`. Ran `make test`: 2 files / 35 tests passed (34 in `vulntriage.test.tsx` + 1 in `app-routing.test.tsx`). `gh run view 39344215807 --log` showed the verify workflow ran `make verify`, then "Tests (make test)", 35 passed and "VERIFY: PASS"; the run at `1be4f95` concluded `success`. `gh repo view`, `gh issue list`, `gh issue view 1`, `gh issue view 2`, `gh issue view 13`, `git ls-files`, `git show` and `gh pr list` confirmed the public tracker, the acceptance criteria and role comments, no backend/database/container/deploy/telemetry/alert/responder files, and no pull requests. Audited score 10/24 (was 7). Verdicts: Testing 1 CONFIRMED (PARTIAL 1); CI/CD 1 CONFIRMED (PARTIAL 1, no CD); Problem Description 2 CONFIRMED (MET 2). Criteria changed since 2026-10-17: Testing 0 -> 1, CI/CD 0 -> 1, Problem Description 1 -> 2. Other criteria unchanged: Application 0, Containerization 0, Deployment 0, Observability 0, Alerting 0, On-Call 0; Product Specification, Agent Team and Context Management remain 2
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; orchestrator to review and commit. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-20 — Roadmap check-in; groom #35 and #33

- date: 2026-10-20
- task/issue: roadmap steps 1, 2 and 6; grooming of #35 and #33. The roadmap step 6 grooming (#3-#8) was already posted before this session and was verified, not redone
- agent role: Orchestrator, with a Rubric Evidence Auditor subagent and two PM subagents
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked whether #13 and step 6 were done, then approved starting step 1, grooming #35/#33 in parallel and updating the step 6 roadmap status. No key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/roadmap.md` (commit `c15e4db`: steps 1-2 `done`, step 6 `doing` pending the batched decision, check-in line). Auditor commit `639b9a9` (`_docs/rubric-evidence.md`, `_docs/ai-usage-log.md`); the auditor's entry says "not committed", which its own commit `639b9a9` supersedes. Session summary `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-20-rubric-refresh-and-grooming.md` and this entry. GitHub: PM rewrote and commented on #35 and #33; PM filed #36 (top-level agent-kit duplicate) and #37 (Claude Code settings asks). #17/#18 were groomed by another session at 00:29 UTC, not by this one
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): auditor ran `make test` (2 files, 35 tests passed) and read CI run 39344215807 (`success`); audited score 10/24 and confirmed Testing 1, CI/CD 1 and Problem Description 2. Orchestrator ran `make verify` after the roadmap edit: PASS WITH WARNINGS (35 tests, whitespace PASS, 7 pre-existing assertion rewrites from #22). `git diff --check` clean. No QA run for the grooming
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Open: the batched #3-#8 decision, PM's two questions on #35 and one on #33, and whether PM should have filed #36/#37 before asking. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-20 — Implement issue #35 push-check plan mode

- date: 2026-10-20
- task/issue: issue #35, "Push check: plan mode (AGENT_PUSH_CHECK_PLAN=1) completes the push without checking (High)". Grooming answers applied: Q1 fix only `_docs/agent-kit` (top-level duplicate left to #36); Q2 plan mode blocks every push, including no-op, deletion-only and no-project pushes
- agent role: Software Engineer
- model: opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): Orchestrator instruction to read `AGENTS.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/team/software-engineer.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/procedures/verify.md`, issue #35 and its comments (PM grooming plus the human's answers), implement the acceptance criteria, leave the protected changes uncommitted for human approval, run Verify, post an Engineer comment and append this entry; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: protected `_docs/agent-kit/environments/local-sandbox/pre-push` and `_docs/agent-kit/environments.md`, left uncommitted pending the human's approval of the exact diff; this entry in `_docs/ai-usage-log.md`. Git-ignored `.scratch/test-push-check-plan.sh` (evidence harness), `.scratch/pre-push-original` (pre-change hook for the non-plan comparison) and `.scratch/push-check-plan-results.txt` (harness output)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS: 2 test files / 35 tests passed, whitespace PASS, weakened tests 7 removed assertion lines that predate this issue (earlier unpushed frontend test changes; this issue changed no test files). `.scratch/test-push-check-plan.sh`: 10 cases, 0 failures (plan line per project, install/install::/none/comment/reinstall detection, working tree versus pushed commit, root fallback, no-new-commits, deletion-only, no-project, removed config, and non-plan byte-for-byte comparison against the original hook for unset/0/other and a failing gate). The sandbox denies `git push`, so the harness invoked the hook directly with git's pre-push stdin and recorded the local bare remote's refs before and after
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the protected diff and its commit await the human's approval, and the human still needs to reinstall the hook in the clean clone and confirm with `cmp`. Commands that stopped for approval: none

- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved creating the issue, and chose D1 option 1 (in the Docker discussion), D2 option 1 and the PM's recommendations for D3-D8. Commands that stopped for approval: none (PM and orchestrator)

### 2026-10-20 — #43 Part 1: proposed spec diff

- date: 2026-10-20
- task/issue: #43 Part 1 (the `_docs/specs.md` diff only; `architecture.md` not started)
- agent role: Engineer (Claude Code `software-engineer` subagent)
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): orchestrator instruction to draft the Part 1 spec diff in `.scratch/` from #43's criteria and the human's answers (comment 6289876616: D1, D2 and D3-D8 option 1), check it with one script and post it; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: none committed; drafts in `.scratch/spec-43/` (`specs.md`, `specs-43.patch`, `check_spec_43.py`); comment https://github.com/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/43#issuecomment-6290123115; this log
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `.scratch/spec-43/check_spec_43.py` 43/43 PASS (includes `git apply --check`, hunk locations, `VERIFY:` on new external claims, status/scan status/reason/KEV consistency). No reviewer verdict yet
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the first diff except uncovered choice 3, and decided that a reinstated `withdrawn` finding restores its pre-withdrawal status (`risk accepted` or `open`). Commands that stopped for approval: none
- revision, same day: changed hunks 4 (`open` and `withdrawn` rows) and 7 (E4) for that decision, stated as restoring the human's recorded acceptance rather than a new one; the patch now carries `index 2d02ddc..782a27c 100644`; check script 48/48 PASS; revised diff posted in https://github.com/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/43#issuecomment-6290358382, awaiting approval of the exact revised diff

### 2026-10-20 — #43 Part 1 protected spec commit and approval record

- date: 2026-10-20
- task/issue: #43 Part 1, after the human approved the exact revised diff
- agent role: Orchestrator
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human approved the revised diff (6290358382) without the optional `risk accepted` row clause; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/specs.md` in `faea412`, committed alone with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`; approval record comment 6290689973; this log. Before review I added only an `index` header line to the first draft's patch, which the Engineer's script later regenerated
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the applied diff was `cmp`-identical to the approved patch before staging; after the commit, `.scratch/spec-43/build_record.py` confirmed one parent, only `_docs/specs.md`, and `git show` identical to the patch. QA runs after Part 2
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): approved the exact revised diff. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-20 — #43 Parts 2 and 3: architecture.md and README link

- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): orchestrator instruction to write `architecture.md` to #43's Part 2 criteria and Stage 2, against the spec at HEAD (`faea412`) and the human's answers (comment 6289876616), check it with one script, run Verify and post the stage report; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/architecture.md` (new) and `README.md` (one link) in `072c17e`; check script `.scratch/arch-43/check_arch_43.py`; comment https://github.com/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/43#issuecomment-6290918784; this log (not committed by me)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): check script 25/25 PASS; `make verify BASE=e15bf29` PASS (35 frontend tests passed, whitespace PASS, no weakened tests). No web fetches: every unconfirmed external detail is tagged `VERIFY:`. No QA verdict yet
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Three spec notes raised for the human (US-4 KEV value before the first KEV fetch, E10 for versionless lockfile entries, stale mark for every `scan failed` reason). Commands that stopped for approval: none
- second spec diff, same day: after the human decided the three spec notes (comment 6291276406), drafted `.scratch/spec-43b/specs-43b.patch` (`index 782a27c..c034181`, 4 hunks, +14 / -9; `git apply --check` passes; `.scratch/spec-43b/check_spec_43b.py` 18/18 PASS) and edited `_docs/architecture.md` in the working tree (A7, A12, A14 now cite the spec; architecture check 25/25 PASS), neither committed; posted in https://github.com/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/43#issuecomment-6291326008, awaiting approval of the exact diff.

- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): approved the decisions, the criteria change and the exact diff. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-20 — #43 QA FAIL fix: types.ts differences table

- Engineer (Claude Code `software-engineer` subagent, claude-opus-5-5), after QA FAIL 6291494669: completed the Data model differences table against `frontend/src/services/types.ts` field by field, changed the spec version on line 3 to `3ecd54b`, and made the US-14 rule `max by (finding_id, tier)` to match its text; `_docs/architecture.md` only, in `974c3f6`. Check script 26/26 PASS (added a check that every `specs.md` commit since the base touches only that file); `make verify BASE=16b445b` PASS. Comment https://github.com/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/43#issuecomment-6291539799. QA re-check not yet run. Commands that stopped for approval: none
- after QA re-check FAIL 6291613521: added the briefs, Scan and Dependency rows, corrected the `affectedRanges` row and the `ServiceErrorCode` 403 citations, made the `epss` row "the score only", and added the server-side-fields rule line after an entity-by-entity pass; `_docs/architecture.md` only, in `6e83ce2`. Check script 26/26 PASS; `make verify BASE=16b445b` PASS. Comment https://github.com/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/43#issuecomment-6291652743. QA re-check not yet run. Commands that stopped for approval: none
- at the decision point, the human chose "no repeat" for the US-14 alert: removed the 24-hour repeat interval (the notification policy never re-sends while unresolved, with `VERIFY:` on the Grafana setting), added that chasing an overdue finding is US-9's reminders and escalation, and dropped the repeat from A33; `_docs/architecture.md` only, in `4180fe3`. Check script 26/26 PASS; `make verify BASE=16b445b` PASS. Comment https://github.com/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/43#issuecomment-6301770281. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-20 — QA and close-out for #43

- date: 2026-10-20
- task/issue: #43 lifecycle steps 4-9 (roadmap step 7)
- agent role: QA Engineer (four fresh Claude Code `qa-engineer` runs), then Orchestrator
- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): orchestrator instructions to check the criteria (then only what changed) and post a verdict; the human's decision-point answers; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: QA comments 6291494669 (FAIL), 6291613521 (FAIL), 6291706212 (PASS), 6301808583 (PASS, alert change); decision-point comment 6301818549; #23 comment 6301758496; #9 body (five boxes ticked) and comment 6301823825; #31 comment 6301824334; `_docs/roadmap.md` (step 7 done, leftovers, check-in line), this log, and the session summary; `make clean-scratch` ran; closed #43
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS; `make verify BASE=16b445b` PASS (35 tests) in every QA run; `make assert-clean` PASS after each QA run (`e8ce1be`, `741489a`, `4b90629`, `6dd32e6`); the #9 body edit was checked by `.scratch/tick_9.py` to change exactly five lines
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human accepted the Engineer's design choices as assumptions, chose no alert repeat, and chose to record the leftovers on #23 and the roadmap. Two tool calls failed with a transient permission-check error and were retried after the human said to continue. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-21 — #23 OpenAPI contract and Stage 3 API table

- date: 2026-10-21
- task/issue: #23 (contract, Stage 3 table, approved Stage 3 text, README links)
- agent role: Engineer (OpenCode `software-engineer` run)
- model: deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (OpenCode)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked for issue #23 against its groomed body and comment 6305987033 (D1-D5 all option 1), with the validator left unrun and its Makefile target supplied as a diff; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/openapi.yaml` (new) in `7d6fe6e`, `_docs/api.md` (new) in `3bdc565`, the exact approved Stage 3 text in `_docs/planning-process.md` alone in `dc94837`, and the two README links in `49a296f`; this log. The proposed protected `Makefile` target is unapplied in `.scratch/makefile-target.diff`; it applies cleanly with `git apply --check`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `.scratch/check_api.cjs` ALL CHECKS PASS (operation set, operationIds, path parameters, security/CSRF, response sets, enums, required keys, forbidden server-side names, api.md coverage, exact Stage 3 text, README links). `make verify` VERIFY: PASS WITH WARNINGS (35/35 frontend tests; whitespace PASS; 7 removed assertions, all from the unpushed #22 commit `759735a`, not from this docs-only issue). The OpenAPI validator was not run: its target needs the human's approval. No reviewer verdict yet
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Awaiting approval for the `openapi-validate` Makefile target and human review of `_docs/openapi.yaml`. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-21 — Permission review: record actions, not outcomes

- date: 2026-10-21
- task/issue: direct human request to correct the permission-review rule; no issue
- agent role: Orchestrator (OpenCode)
- model: deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (OpenCode)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked to review how permission requests are recorded in session summaries, then directed that the agent must not record whether permission was granted, only the actions that required asking; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `1b37fd1` (protected, HUMAN_APPROVED=1; approved in this session): `AGENTS.md` and seven `_docs/agent-kit/` files; this log and `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-21-permission-review.md`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (35/35 frontend tests; whitespace PASS; 7 removed assertions from the earlier unpushed #22 test rewrite, not this docs-only change); `git diff --check` clean. No QA verdict (direct docs change)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): approved the exact eight-file diff in this session. Commands and changes that required approval, outcomes not recorded: editing the eight protected paths (`edit` `ask` rules); the `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` commit (merits); `gh issue edit 23` by the PM (`gh issue edit*` `ask` rule)

### 2026-10-21 — #23 contract follow-up: A-N review decisions

- date: 2026-10-21

- agent role: Engineer (OpenCode `software-engineer` run)
- model: deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (OpenCode)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the orchestrator relayed the A-N items, the instruction not to edit the Makefile or run the validator, and item O's revised-target requirements; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/openapi.yaml` in `3cb40af` (A, B, C, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, N) and `_docs/api.md` in `d9817f9` (A, B, F, G, H, I, K, and the contract-order wording); this log. The revised protected-target diff is unapplied in `.scratch/makefile-target.diff`; it applies cleanly with `git apply --check`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `.scratch/check_api.cjs` ALL CHECKS PASS, including the ten-operation set, 403 on registerAsset/reScan, the 401 -> 403 CSRF -> 404 -> 403 owner -> 422 -> 409 order and its refused case, strict request bodies, the FindingId/AssetId parameter refs, the tightened repositoryUrl pattern and its refused cases, required nullable actorDisplayName, epss bounds, ownerEmail format, and the api.md pagination/owner-match rows. `make verify BASE=5a41e30` VERIFY: PASS (35/35 frontend tests; whitespace PASS; no test files changed). The default `make verify` gave PASS WITH WARNINGS: 35/35 tests, whitespace PASS, and 7 removed assertions from the earlier unpushed #22 commit `759735a`, not from this docs-only change. The validator was not run: the target still needs the human's approval. The proposed target pins `openapi-spec-validator==0.9.0`, checked on the PyPI project page on 2026-10-21 (release 0.9.0, uploaded 2026-05-20)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Awaiting the human's approval of the revised target diff and review of `_docs/openapi.yaml` at `3cb40af`. Commands that stopped for approval: none

### 2026-10-21 — #23 approved `openapi-validate` target and validator runs

- date: 2026-10-21
- task/issue: #23 (apply the approved revised target, post its approval record, run the validator and refusal cases, run Verify)
- agent role: Engineer (OpenCode `software-engineer` run)
- model: deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (OpenCode)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the orchestrator relayed the human's 2026-10-21 approval of the revised target diff at `.scratch/makefile-target.diff` and of running the validator on the real file and the broken-`$ref` case; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: the protected `Makefile` in `aa066fc19047042595e252ebbcfd9914955814bb`, committed alone with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`; approval record https://github.com/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/23#issuecomment-6308646350; Engineer comment https://github.com/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/23#issuecomment-6308754845; this log. No changes to `_docs/openapi.yaml`, `_docs/api.md` or any test
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git apply --check .scratch/makefile-target.diff` passed before applying; the posted approval-record diff was checked byte-identical to `git show --format= --no-renames --patch aa066fc19047042595e252ebbcfd9914955814bb -- Makefile`. `make openapi-validate` on `_docs/openapi.yaml` exited 0 with `_docs/openapi.yaml: OK`; on `.scratch/openapi-broken-ref2.yaml` (one broken response `$ref`) exited 2; on `OPENAPI=../x.yaml` exited 2 at `Makefile:59` before the validator ran. Noted: `openapi-spec-validator 0.9.0` did not catch a broken `$ref` placed in a request-body schema (`.scratch/openapi-broken-ref.yaml`, exit 0), so the recorded refusal case uses a response `$ref`. `make verify` over all unpushed work: VERIFY: PASS WITH WARNINGS, 35/35 frontend tests, whitespace PASS, 7 removed/rewritten assertions all from the unpushed #22 commit `759735a`, not this change. No reviewer verdict yet
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the exact revised target diff and the validator runs in this session; the contract review at `3cb40af` is still pending. Commands that stopped for approval: `git apply .scratch/makefile-target.diff` (protected `Makefile`; merits); the `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` commit (protected-file commit; merits); `make openapi-validate` and `uvx openapi-spec-validator==0.9.0 --version` (validator download/run; merits); `cat` reads of project/issue files, `cp` into `.scratch/`, and the `.scratch` check scripts (matched the `*` ask rule)

### 2026-10-21 — Cloud-sessions readiness check and #44 filed

- date: 2026-10-21
- task/issue: status check of `_docs/cloud-sessions.md`; filed #44 for its section 3 repo changes

- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): read-only checks: section 3 is 0 of 5 done (`Makefile` `issue-dump` still uses `gh issue view`; `.claude/settings.json` has the blanket `git push` deny and no SessionStart hook; `guard_git.py` has no cloud exception; `cloud_session_start.sh` absent; `AGENTS.md` has no cloud profile). `gh api .../rulesets` shows "Protect Main Branch" with the planned rules but enforcement `disabled`; `gh api .../rules/branches/main` returns `[]`. GitHub `main` at `5a41e30`, 5 local commits behind `052f53a`. Repo merge-method settings not readable with the read-only token. `gh issue list --state all` found no existing issue for section 3. No tests run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the issue draft in plan mode before it was filed; #44's "Decision needed" (work now, after #23, or deferred) is open. Commands that stopped for approval: none recorded by this session beyond the plan approval

### 2026-10-21 — #23 decision point: approved AGENTS.md, spec and architecture changes

- date: 2026-10-21
- task/issue: #23 (apply three changes the human approved in this session, each in its own focused commit, and post the two protected-change approval records)
- agent role: Engineer (OpenCode `software-engineer` run)
- model: deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (OpenCode)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the orchestrator relayed the human's 2026-10-21 in-session approval of the exact AGENTS.md Commands line, the three spec sentences (US-6, US-10, US-11) and the A30 sentence, plus the commit rules; no key prompt file saved

This log
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `git diff --check` was clean before each commit, and each staged tree contained only the named path. The posted Diff blocks were copied from `git show --format= --no-renames --patch <commit> -- <path>` for the same commit and path. `make verify`: VERIFY: PASS WITH WARNINGS (35/35 frontend tests; whitespace PASS; 7 removed or rewritten assertion lines, all from the unpushed #22 commit `759735a`, not this docs-only change). No reviewer verdict yet
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the exact three changes in this session on 2026-10-21; there is no approval-comment URL. Commands and changes that required approval: editing the protected `AGENTS.md` and `_docs/specs.md` (`ask` rules for those paths, and human approval for protected files); the two `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` commits (protected-file commit, merits); `gh api repos/andrew-chung-au/vuln-triage/issues/comments/6308646350 --jq .body` (`gh api*` `ask` rule)

- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the contract at `3cb40af`, the validator target and runs, the `AGENTS.md` line, all three spec sentences, the A30 note, one QA-risks follow-up (#46), filing #45, and scheduling #44 after #23. Commands that required approval: `gh issue comment` on #23 and #44 (writes to the record); the protected-file edits and `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` commits (merits requests); `make openapi-validate` (merits request)

### 2026-10-21 — #44 grooming, implementation and close-out

GitHub: grooming comment 6310709588, live `make issue-comment` test 6311435040, Engineer evidence 6314178652, QA 6314003194 (FAIL) and 6314208500 (PASS), follow-up #47
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): Engineer checks: guard matrix 30/30, SessionStart 7/7, settings 14/14, issue-target refusals 16/16, `make verify BASE=HEAD` PASS. QA FAILed only on two record-keeping criteria (the matrix and the live-comment URL were not in an issue comment); after the Engineer posted 6314178652, QA PASS at `8eeaf53` (6314208500). `make assert-clean` PASS
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the exact six-file protected diff (one commit) and filing #47 for the four outside-criteria risks; they deferred the `_docs/cloud-sessions.md` notes to the § 5 trial follow-up. Commands that required approval: the protected-file edits and the `HUMAN_APPROVED=1 git commit` (merits requests); `make issue-comment` (GitHub write to the record); `gh issue create` for #47 (GitHub write)

### 2026-10-21 — Cloud-session readiness check and setup guide

- model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked for a readiness check, then explicit settings, then to update `_docs/cloud-sessions.md` without duplication; no key prompt file saved
- files changed: `_docs/cloud-sessions.md` (status line; § 2 table now shows how #44 handles each difference; § 3 records what #44 implemented; § 4 split into 4.1-4.5 with the ruleset, pull request, GitHub connection and environment-form settings; § 5 adds author, `Claude-Session` trailer, `jq` and `HEAD:main` checks; § 6 adds the permission-mode note) and this log
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): read-only `gh api` checks: local `main` = GitHub `main` = `d49c2e0`; last three CI `verify` runs on `main` succeeded; ruleset 25525417 "Protect Main Branch" has the right rules but `enforcement: disabled` and admin bypass `always`; merge-method settings unreadable with the sandbox token (`null`). Doc facts checked against code.claude.com pages (claude-code-on-the-web, cloud-environments, web-quickstart) and `guard_git.py`. No tests run (docs only)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Commands that required approval: none beyond the `make *`/`gh api repos/*` allow rules (all `gh api` calls were reads)

### 2026-10-21 — Cloud-session trial (`_docs/cloud-sessions.md` § 5)

- date: 2026-10-21
- task/issue: none (the § 5 trial before real cloud work)
- agent role: a Claude Code cloud session on branch `claude/keen-allen-185yyr`, driven by the human with prompts drafted by the local main session; the local main session recorded the results
- model: local main session claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Code); the cloud session's model was not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): three trial prompts drafted in the local session (trial checks; empty commit and pushes; Docker follow-up); not saved as key prompts
- files changed: `_docs/cloud-sessions.md` (§ 5.1 results; resolved `VERIFY:` items for Node 22, `jq`, branch prefix, commit author and Docker Hub hosts; Docker and Postgres not running at start) and this log. Cloud session: empty commit `1c6286a` pushed to `claude/keen-allen-185yyr` (not merged); `.scratch/` files only in the cloud VM
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): reported by the cloud session and pasted by the human: banner printed; `make verify` PASS 35/35 on Node 22.22.0; `make issue-dump N=41` wrote both files; `core.hooksPath` = `.githooks`; author `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`, no `Claude-Session` trailer; branch push worked; `git push origin main` and `HEAD:main` refused by `guard_git.py` (GitHub ruleset not reached); Docker daemon not running, `service docker start` failed on `ulimit`, `sudo dockerd` worked and `hello-world` ran, then the daemon was stopped; Postgres service down. The local session read `.githooks/pre-push` to confirm an empty commit has nothing to verify
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human ran the trial and sent each prompt. Commands that required approval: none in the cloud session (it reported none, including its `sudo dockerd` start and stop, which the human's prompt named); none locally beyond the allow rules

### 2026-10-21 — Cloud-trial follow-ups (#48, #47 comment)

- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): read-only `gh api` check: ruleset 25525417 `enforcement: active`, admin bypass `pull_request`. No tests run (docs and issues only)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved filing #48 and the #47 comment, and changed the bypass themselves; D1/D2 on #48 not answered yet. Commands that required approval: `gh issue create` for #48 (GitHub write to the record); `make issue-comment N=47` (GitHub write to the record, under the `make *` allow rule)

- agent role: Orchestrator (main session) with PM, Engineer and QA subagents (two QA runs), on branch `claude/vigilant-heisenberg-qtr2f3`
- model: claude-sonnet-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's request to review the issues and roadmap and pick the highest-priority task that does not conflict with the agent working on #56, then "yes" to start; the subagent task messages followed `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/openapi.yaml` and `_docs/api.md` (`2e9a4dd`), `_docs/architecture.md` (`4cebbd2`), `_docs/api.md` (`b7b4d36`), `_docs/roadmap.md` (step 8b row, check-in), this log, `_session-summaries/issue-058-contract-follow-ups.md`. GitHub: #58 comments 6329518860 (PM grooming), 6329573230 (human's decisions), 6329595990 (Engineer), 6329679240 (approval record posted by mistake), 6329697265 (QA FAIL), 6329737124 (correction note), 6329743761 (QA PASS); the groomed body was applied to #58 by the orchestrator through the GitHub issue tool because `gh issue edit` is blocked in cloud sessions
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make openapi-validate` exit 0 and `make verify` PASS (62/62) at `2e9a4dd` (Engineer) and on both pushes; parsed-YAML diff showed description text only; QA FAIL at `b7b4d36` only because `_docs/architecture.md` is not in `PROTECTED`, then QA PASS on the re-check (6329743761), with the other verdicts carried over; `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD `b7b4d36` unchanged after both QA runs
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose D1 and D2 (option 1, recommended), approved spec notes 1 and 3 and the exact `architecture.md` diff, approved the contract at `2e9a4dd`, and chose option 2 (architecture.md gated by convention, `PROTECTED` unchanged) after QA's FAIL. The orchestrator wrongly posted a protected-change record for `4cebbd2` without checking `PROTECTED`; corrected in 6329737124. Commands that required approval: none (the `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` commit of `4cebbd2` was not required by `PROTECTED`; `git push -u origin` of the session branch is the cloud-session exception)

- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `python3 -m json.tool` exit 0 on the proposed settings; a script modelling the rule shapes showed the four #60 commands plus two extra flag forms matching the `Bash(gh api *)` ask and no allow rule, and `make issue-dump`, `make issue-comment` and `make issue-close` matched by `make *` allow and the `make issue-close*` ask; `git apply --check` passed for all three diff files; the `.scratch/` regression script (refused `SINCE` values, allowed values, parser fixtures) passed; the report was run on the real session summaries. Not run: `make verify`, a live Claude Code prompt check, QA
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Commands that required approval: none known (I cannot see whether the tool prompted for an `ask`-rule command)

### 2026-10-22 — #60, #37 and #61 orchestration: permission settings and the permission sweep

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: #60, #37, #61; chosen from the human's request to prioritise tooling targets and to work them on a separate branch, off the roadmap, beside the product session on step 10
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session) with PM, Engineer and QA subagents (one run each), on branch `claude/beautiful-lovelace-la54rn`
- model: claude-sonnet-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's requests to rank the tooling issues, to groom #60, #37 and #61 together and to go with the recommendations; the subagent task messages followed `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `.claude/settings.json` (`a5b21c0`), `Makefile` and `_docs/agent-kit/scripts/permission-report.py` (`2520c9c`), `AGENTS.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/templates/session-summary.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/procedures/session-summary.md`, `_docs/agent-kit/procedures/permission-sweep.md` (`4c42cf3`), `_docs/cloud-sessions.md`, `_docs/permission-sweeps.md`, the Engineer log entry above and this one, `_session-summaries/issue-060-037-061-permission-settings.md` (`509215b` and this session's closing commit). The Engineer's entry above was written before the commits and says "uncommitted" and "proposed, not applied"; the commits above are the real state. GitHub: PM 6330134485, 6330134704, 6330137277; decisions 6330251791; Engineer 6330334016, 6330335550, 6330334233; approval records 6330381464, 6330381694, 6330381921, 6330382170; QA 6330439958, 6330440182, 6330440402
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS (62/62) on the pre-push run and in QA's run; QA PASS on all three issues at `509215b`, including the approval records against the commits, the settings rule sets, 31 refused `SINCE` values and the report counts; `make assert-clean` PASS after QA. Not verified: a live Claude Code prompt check for the new ask rules (needs a new session)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose the six PM decisions as recommended, approved the three protected diffs as drafted, and kept the work off the roadmap. Commands that required approval: none known; the `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` commits and `git push -u origin` of the session branch are the protected-change and cloud-session cases

### 2026-10-22 — #60, #37 and #61 follow-up: live prompt check result and two follow-up issues

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: #60, #37 (live prompt check); new issues #65 (first permission sweep) and #66 (`make issue-close` ask rule bypassed by option order)
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session), on branch `claude/beautiful-lovelace-la54rn`
- model: claude-sonnet-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's requests for a test prompt and branch instructions for a new session, then "confirmed" and "approve recommendations"; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/permission-sweeps.md` (points to #65; notes that cloud sessions skip `Edit` asks), this log. GitHub: comments 6330923566 (#60) and 6330923814 (#37); issues #65 and #66 created through the GitHub MCP `issue_write` tool (no REST make target for creating issues)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the live check was run by the human in a local default-mode session on the branch, with a test agent running the commands; the human reported prompts on all six `gh api` commands and on the `.devcontainer/` write, and none on the `make issue-dump` control. Tests for `.githooks/`, `.github/` and `.vscode/` were not run. Two earlier runs gave no result (wrong branch; cloud session, which does not prompt for edits). The orchestrator did not observe any prompt itself
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human ran and observed the live check, confirmed the three details, deleted the test file in their sandbox, and approved filing #65 and #66. Commands that required approval: `make issue-comment` and `make issue-close` per the ask rules; creating issues through `issue_write` is the recurring MCP item counted by `make permission-report`

### 2026-10-22 — #56 orchestrator, PM, Engineer and QA: Stage 4 test strategy

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: #56 (Stage 4 `_docs/testing.md`, roadmap step 10); follow-up #63 filed for the four deferred spec notes
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session) with PM, Software Engineer and QA subagents, on branch `claude/issue-056-stage-4-testing`; worktree shared with the paused #50/#58 sessions, so the branch was rebased on the merged `origin/main` before close-out
- model: deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (opencode)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's "please work on Step 10 issue: #56 ... follow process.md" and the later decisions on D1, branch strategy, deferring the spec notes, note-only QA risks and pushing the branch; role launch prompts followed `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/testing.md` (new, 385 lines) and `README.md` (`8d9db69`, `2430912`); `_docs/roadmap.md` (step 10 row, #43 leftover line, check-in), this log and `_session-summaries/issue-056-stage-4-testing.md` at close-out. GitHub: #56 comments 6329411066 (PM grooming), 6329460170 (PM body-edit note), 6329735908 (Engineer), 6329945929 (QA PASS); #9 two Stage 4 rows ticked; #63 created
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS (6329945929) before the rebase, re-check PASS at `ae0d55d` (6330289999) after it; `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD unchanged after each QA; `make verify` PASS (62/62, no whitespace errors, no test files changed), plus `make verify BASE=origin/main` to cover the branch's missing upstream; `make issue-dump N=9` confirmed only the two Stage 4 rows changed; `make openapi-validate` was not needed (no contract edit)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose D1 option 1 (a resolution is not a second alert), told me to move the work to its own branch and rebase on the merged sessions, chose one follow-up issue for the four spec notes (#63), and chose note-only for the QA risks. Commands that required approval: PM/Engineer `gh api -X PATCH` body edits (#56, #9) and the PM Git read loop (ask rules); PM `gh issue create` for #63 (issue-creation rule); `git push -u origin claude/issue-056-stage-4-testing` (denied by the `git push*` rule; the branch stays local for the human to push)

### 2026-10-22 — #53, #48, #31 orchestration: grooming and scheduling on a parallel tooling track

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: #53, #48, #31 (grooming and roadmap scheduling only; no implementation); new issues #67 and #68
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session) with a PM subagent, on branch `claude/beautiful-lovelace-la54rn`
- model: claude-sonnet-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's request to schedule #53 and #48/#31 as parallel tooling work; the PM task message followed `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/roadmap.md` (parallel tooling track T1-T3, step 16 row, Later list, check-in), this log. GitHub: PM comments 6331077862, 6331105969 (#53), 6331091593 (#48), 6331105799 (#31); human's answers 6331014940 (#48 D1/D2) and 6331160446 and copies on #53, #48, #31; issues #67 (CI passes a real `BASE`) and #68 (run #26's persistence test against Postgres) created through the GitHub MCP `issue_write` tool
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the PM ran `make frontend-typecheck` (exit 0 at `26ac31a`) and read the verify scripts, hooks and `.devcontainer/`; no implementation, no QA. The PM's first #53 comment had two small errors, superseded by its correction comment 6331105969
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human answered #48 D1/D2 and the placement question, then D1-D5 as recommended. Commands that required approval: `make issue-comment` (allowed target); issue creation through `issue_write`

### 2026-10-22 — Human cheatsheet for reviewing, pushing and merging agent work

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: no issue; the human's request for a cheatsheet of the current push process, then for example commands
- agent role: single Claude Code session (no subagents), on branch `claude/human-cheatsheet`
- model: claude-sonnet-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's request for a cheatsheet "for using the current process for pushing to the repo from the sandbox", their note that the method has evolved from the original agent kit, and "the cheat sheet needs example commands etc"; no key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/human-cheatsheet.md` (new), `README.md` (one index line), this log
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none run on the commands; the process was read from `environments.md`, `process.md`, `cloud-sessions.md`, the roadmap, the #56 summary and `git branch -a`. Items marked `VERIFY:` in the file (the local-sandbox branch flow, `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge` from the human's machine) are unconfirmed. No QA run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human confirmed the described method "looks correct" and asked for example commands. Commands that required approval: none recorded

### 2026-10-22 — #72 orchestrator, PM, Engineer and QA: Stage 5 task backlog

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: #72 (Stage 5 `_docs/tasks.md`, roadmap step 11); follow-ups #73 (README `withdrawn` and Stage 5 tier-label note) and `andrew-chung-au/agent-kit` #19 (task-template naming)
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session) with PM, Software Engineer and QA subagents, on `main` in the local sandbox
- model: deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (opencode)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's "check the roadmap and issue for the next product driven issue to work on", the clarification question about Stage 4 and #24, then "ok got it then do step 11"; the role launches followed `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/tasks.md` (new, 36 tasks) and `README.md` (one link line) at `05e3e60`; `_docs/tasks.md` (`ae6b708`, US-15 `Covers:` alignment); `_docs/roadmap.md`, this log and `_session-summaries/issue-072-stage-5-tasks.md` at close-out. GitHub: #72 created; comments 6331775484 (human D1/D2), 6331821940 (PM grooming), 6332002908 (Engineer), 6332195958 (QA PASS), 6332266585 (Engineer US-15 fix), 6332346303 (QA re-check PASS); #73 and agent-kit #19 created
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS (6332195958) and re-check PASS (6332346303); `make assert-clean` PASS with HEAD unchanged (`05e3e60`, then `ae6b708`) after each; `make verify` PASS both times (62 tests, no whitespace errors, no test files changed); the Engineer's read-only `.scratch/check_tasks.py` passed (36 tasks, 16 user stories, 12 criteria, lower-numbered acyclic dependencies, dependency chain matches)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved filing #72 and chose D1 (rubric-tier milestones A/B/C then a Committed scope section) and D2 (one planning-evidence task), both recommended; chose fix-now for the US-15 alignment and note-only for the task-sizing risks; directed the three follow-ups (agent-kit #19, and #73 for the two doc notes). Commands that required approval: `gh issue create` for #72 and #73 (issue-creation rule) and for agent-kit #19 (same rule, another repo); `gh issue edit 72` (issue-edit ask rule); `make issue-comment` (allowed target)

### 2026-10-22 — #53 orchestrator, Engineer and QA: verify gate type check and BASE handling

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: #53 (roadmap track T1: type check in `make verify`; BASE warning and failure)
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session) with a Software Engineer subagent and QA subagents (two runs, the second a narrow re-check), on branch `claude/start-53-7oaxg3`
- model: claude-sonnet-5-5 (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's "Start #53"; role launch prompts followed `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/testing.md` (`291b4bc`); `_docs/agent-kit/scripts/verify.sh` and `_docs/agent-kit/procedures/verify.md` (`bdda483`); `agent-kit.conf` (`e0cf368`); `AGENTS.md` line 35 (`1d869a5`); `_docs/agent-kit/scripts/verify.sh` again (`3d978fe`, one line); `_docs/roadmap.md` (check-in), this log and `_session-summaries/issue-053-verify-gate-gaps.md` at close-out. GitHub on #53: Engineer 6331467458; QA 6331468388; approval records 6331468586, 6331468781, 6331469012, 6331469216
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=6ed87ed` PASS (62 tests, `PASS: Type check`) and the pre-push runs PASS; QA PASS at `1d869a5`, then re-check PASS at `3d978fe` after the stderr fix; QA re-ran `BASE=HEAD` (warns), `BASE=nosuchref` (fails), `BASE=72903cc^` (lists the changed test file), `BASE=3d38e34` (clean), the empty-tree base and a deliberate type error (`FAIL: Type check`, reverted); `make assert-clean` PASS and HEAD unchanged after both QA runs. Not verified: the sandbox push check was read, not run (no Docker)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved all three protected diffs as drafted, and chose "Fix it now" for the stray stderr line QA found (a fourth protected commit), "No, already tracked" for the other QA notes. Commands that required approval: `HUMAN_APPROVED=1 git commit` of `bdda483`, `e0cf368`, `1d869a5`, `3d978fe` (protected files); `git push -u origin claude/start-53-7oaxg3` (cloud-session exception); `make issue-comment` (allowed target)

### 2026-10-22 — Step 12 orchestration: Milestone A backlog from `_docs/tasks.md`

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: roadmap step 12 (backlog issues from `_docs/tasks.md`); created #74, #75, #76-#88; edited #26; closed #24 and #25
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session) with a PM subagent; no Engineer or QA stage (backlog and tracker work only)
- model: deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (opencode)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's "groom the next step"; the PM task followed `_docs/agent-kit/process.md`; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/roadmap.md` (step 12 and 15 rows, check-in), this log, `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-22-step-12-backlog.md` at close-out. GitHub: #74-#88 created from `.scratch/` body files; #26 edited; #24/#25 closed, comments 6333191444 and 6333194914; block note 6333211529 on #74
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): no code or test change; `make verify` not run. The proposal checked `_docs/tasks.md` against `_docs/specs.md` and the open tracker with a read-only `gh issue list`. The human approved the proposal before any issue was created, edited or closed
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose Milestone A filing now, closing #24/#25 and rewriting #26, the 9/10 splits, accepting #63 notes before Milestone C, and deciding the LLM/responder runtime at milestone start with stubs. The orchestrator corrected issue 1's draft so `make test` keeps the frontend suite. Commands that required approval: `gh issue create` for #74-#88 (issue-creation rule); `gh issue edit 26` (issue-edit ask rule); `make issue-comment` (allowed target); `make issue-close` on #24/#25 (issue-close ask rule)

### 2026-10-22 — Orchestrator: temporary Tier B/C roadmap

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: none (planning; the human asked for a secondary roadmap for Tiers B and C while another session works roadmap step 11)
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session), on branch `claude/kind-einstein-i39rmh`
- model: Claude Code (cloud session)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's request with the final-project criteria and the Module 2-4 notes and homework pasted; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/roadmap-tiers-b-c.md` (new, temporary), this log, `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-22-tier-b-c-roadmap.md`. `_docs/roadmap.md` not changed
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` run before commit (result in the session summary); no QA or rubric-auditor review
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; seven decisions (D1-D7) are open in the new file, which maps its milestones to the `tasks.md` task numbers from PR #89. Commands that required approval: none recorded

### 2026-10-22 — Orchestrator: merge the Tier B/C roadmap draft

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: none (planning; the human asked to review and merge `_docs/roadmap-tiers-b-c.md` into `_docs/roadmap.md` and delete the draft)
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session), local sandbox on `main`
- model: deepseek-v4.1-flash-free (opencode)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's request to review and merge the two roadmap files, delete the draft, then review the roadmap and start the next product issue; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/roadmap.md` (step 17 milestones B1-B6/C1-C8, prerequisites, task mapping, AWS-slow order, open decisions 5-11, B/C checkpoints, check-in); `_docs/roadmap-tiers-b-c.md` (deleted); this log; `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-22-roadmap-tier-b-c-merge.md`
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (62 tests, type check pass, no whitespace errors, no test files changed; the warning is `BASE` equal to `HEAD` for a docs-only change). No QA or rubric-auditor review
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human directed the merge and deletion; D1-D7 were carried over as open, not answered. Commands that required approval: none recorded

### 2026-10-22 — #91 orchestrator, PM, Engineer and QA: Stage 6 plan summary

- date: 2026-10-22

GitHub: #91 created; comments 6334007642 (PM), 6334298084 (Engineer), 6335550333 (QA FAIL), 6336177091 (QA re-check PASS); #95 created
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA FAIL at `e8e4ddb` on the completeness counts and a false checklist PASS; Engineer `882c75d` fixed the label-only counts and evidence; QA re-check PASS at `882c75d` (6336177091); `make verify BASE=1edc468` PASS (62 tests, type check, whitespace, no weakened tests); `make assert-clean` PASS with HEAD unchanged after both QA runs
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human deferred the protected spec Q2-Q4 note to the next spec change, approved filing one follow-up (#95) for the tasks.md Application/task 15 discrepancy with README `withdrawn` left to #73, and chose note-only for the minor checklist recount wording. Commands that required approval: `gh issue create` for #91 and #95 (issue-creation rule); `make issue-comment` (allowed target)

### 2026-10-22 — Orchestrator: parallel-work analysis and AWS setup guide

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: none (planning). The human asked which work can run beside another session's roadmap step 13 (`_docs/plan-summary.md`) without conflict, without editing either roadmap; then, with #48 set aside (cloud credits), for a guide to the AWS setup the Tier B/C work needs
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session), on branch `claude/tender-volta-wiq6xv`
- model: Claude Code (cloud session)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's two requests in chat; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/aws-setup.md` (new), this log, `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-22-aws-setup.md`. Neither roadmap and no README link (step 13 edits the README index)

- files changed: this log and `_session-summaries/issue-073-readme-withdrawn-tier-label.md` (the Engineer's commits are in its own entry). GitHub: #73 comment 6334352037 (human answers), #92 created (body later trimmed and one comment deleted at the human's direction: discussion material was not to be saved), #73 closed
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS at `6248c29` (6334401494); `make assert-clean` PASS, HEAD unchanged
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human answered the PM's decisions (Stage 5 sentence matches the architecture Tier column; leave the brief). The orchestrator checked the PM's architecture-tier claim against `_docs/architecture.md` before asking. Commands that required approval: none recorded

### 2026-10-22 — Orchestrator: submission and showcase tracks

- date: 2026-10-22

- agent role: Orchestrator (main session), on branch `claude/tender-volta-wiq6xv`
- model: Claude Code (cloud session)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's questions on the deployment approach, ease and speed, and a CV showcase; the human chose two tracks, Terraform, GHCR, `sslip.io` and deferring n8n; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/roadmap-submission-draft.md` (new, temporary), `_docs/roadmap-showcase.md` (new, kept separate), `_docs/aws-setup.md` (status line), this log, `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-22-submission-showcase.md`. Neither existing roadmap changed
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` before commit (result in the session summary); no QA or rubric-auditor review; the drafts were checked against `_docs/rubric.md` and the `_docs/tasks.md` task list by the author only
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human made decisions H1-H7 in the session (recorded in the submission draft). Commands that required approval: none recorded

### 2026-10-22 — Engineer: #73 README withdrawn status and Stage 5 tier note

- date: 2026-10-22
- task/issue: #73 (lifecycle step 3, implementation)

- model: claude-sonnet-5-5 (Claude Code). Recorded exception, human decision 2026-10-22: same tool as the plan's authors, not the author's model for most of the plan (claude-opus-5-5), but the same model as the Engineer subagents of #107 and #108 stage 1 (claude-sonnet-5-5), which edited the documents just before the run

- model: `opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free` (OpenCode). The handoff named Claude Code sonnet for run 2; subagents in this environment inherit the main session model, and the review file records the actual model. Human decision 2026-10-23: accept this run as the independent run because it is a different tool and model from the plan's authors (`claude-opus-5-5` and the sonnet engineers), which is the stronger independence; the deviation from the sonnet choice is recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): `_docs/prompts/reviewer-plan-review.md` plus the orchestrator's run notes; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/reviews/2026-10-22-plan-review-2.md` (`fc89dcf`, the Reviewer's only commit); this log entry (appended by the orchestrator)

- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make test` PASS (frontend 62 tests, backend 3: `test_smoke`, `U-NET`, `I-NET`); `make verify BASE=8910c8a` PASS WITH WARNINGS (whitespace PASS; type check PASS; the only warnings are "test fixtures changed" for the new `tests/conftest.py` and `tests/fixtures/MANIFEST.md`, which are additions, not loosened fixtures); red run with the guard temporarily disabled: U-NET and I-NET both failed (`DID NOT RAISE OutboundNetworkBlocked`), temporary edit reverted; `LLM_MODE=live` manual run exited 4 before collection; scope greps empty; no QA or review yet
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Commands that required approval: `uv lock` and `make install` for the approved fastapi/uvicorn/sqlalchemy/pytest batch (network downloads, pre-approved by the human in this session); `git commit` including `.github/workflows/verify.yml` was blocked by the kit hook, which requires `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` (returned to the orchestrator; the CI file is uncommitted); the protected `Makefile` diff is left uncommitted for the orchestrator's `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` commit

The first three commits were made in the earlier part of the session; the close-out only confirmed them against `git log` and the issue comments
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS at `f2afe1e` (comment 6356100822); QA's `make verify BASE=8910c8a` PASS WITH WARNINGS (62 frontend + 3 backend tests; the only warning is "test fixtures changed" for the new harness files); `make assert-clean` PASS after QA (as reported in the earlier session). I did not re-run `make verify` in the close-out; the tree was clean at `4952e6b`
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the Makefile diff (record 6355572492) and the AGENTS.md diff (record 6356140221), both committed with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1`, and approved filing the npm-vulnerability follow-up, filed as #111 (Not in S1). I checked the usage log's earlier Engineer entry: its "Makefile and CI uncommitted" statement was true at hand-over and is superseded by the commits above. Commands that required approval: `HUMAN_APPROVED=1 git commit` for `Makefile` and `AGENTS.md` (protected files); `make issue-comment` and `make issue-close` (ask rules)

- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): after the lock, `make backend-test` first failed the drift test (the model's inferred float column vs the migration; fixed by declaring `Float` explicitly), then passed: 56 passed. `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (frontend 62, backend 56, type check and whitespace PASS; the only warning is "test fixtures changed" for `tests/conftest.py`, which now enables the foreign-key pragma, a tightening; `tests/fixtures/MANIFEST.md` is flagged only because the diff base is origin/main). No QA or review
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Commands that required approval: protected `Makefile` commit d811e9b with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` (merits request, protected file); `make backend-lock` and `make backend-install` (network, new dependency alembic 1.20.1 with mako 1.4.3 and markupsafe 3.0.4); WebFetch of the PyPI alembic JSON

I did not re-run `make verify` after the later `architecture.md` and `AGENTS.md` commits, which change no code
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved Alembic, the exact `Makefile` diff (record 6356828269) and the `AGENTS.md` diff (record 6356930604), the architecture rewording, and noting QA's risks only. I replaced one muddled criterion in the PM's #112 draft before filing. Commands that required approval: `HUMAN_APPROVED=1 git commit` for `Makefile` and `AGENTS.md` (protected files); `make backend-lock` and `make backend-install` (network, new dependency); `make issue-comment` and `make issue-close` (ask rules)

### 2026-10-23 — Engineer: #112 push-check image Dockerfile (committed, not built)

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #112 (push-check image); issue not closed, QA not run
- agent role: Software Engineer subagent, local sandbox on `main`
- model: `claude-sonnet-5-5` (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the orchestrator's instruction to implement #112 with the human's decisions (custom image, Python 3.12 baked in, `ci/push-check/Dockerfile`, all four extra tools); no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `ci/push-check/Dockerfile` (new, commit 83260c0); this log. `AGENTS.md` not edited (proposed diff returned to the orchestrator)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (62 frontend + 56 backend tests; the warning is the fixtures flag against origin/main from earlier issues, not from this change). The image was NOT built or tested: there is no Docker in this container. Versions looked up by web fetch: pip-audit 2.10.1 (PyPI), Terraform 1.17.0 with SHA-256 sums (releases.hashicorp.com), Python 3.12.15 (python.org), node:24.22.0-bookworm digest (Docker Hub), uv 0.13.1 release exists (GitHub). Unverified: the npm bundled in the base image, ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.13.1 tag, offline `uvx` from the baked cache
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none. Commands that required approval: none

### 2026-10-23 — Orchestrator: #112 push-check image (QA PASS on the static criteria; issue left open)

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #112 (push-check image), orchestration: PM draft and filing, Engineer, QA
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session) with PM, Software Engineer and QA subagents
- model: `claude-sonnet-5-5` (Claude Code) for the orchestrator and all three subagents
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's request to file an issue for the push-check failure, then their answers (custom image, Python baked in, Dockerfile in the repo, all four extra tools, scheduled right after #26); no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `83260c0` (`ci/push-check/Dockerfile`), `9902d07` (`AGENTS.md`, protected), `_session-summaries/issue-112-push-check-image.md`, `_docs/roadmap.md` check-in; this log entry
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA PASS for the criteria checkable by reading (comment 6357004988) at `9902d07`; `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (62 frontend + 56 backend tests); `make assert-clean` PASS after QA. The image was not built or run (no Docker in this container); the criteria that need the image are not verified and wait for the human
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved filing #112, the image scope, and the `AGENTS.md` text (record 6356988788). I corrected one muddled criterion in the PM draft before filing. Commands that required approval: `HUMAN_APPROVED=1 git commit` for `AGENTS.md` (protected file); `make issue-comment` (ask rule)

### 2026-10-23 — Orchestrator: #112 step-by-step guide for the human

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #112 (push-check image), at the human's request: a detailed guide saying where each step runs
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session), no subagent
- model: `claude-sonnet-5-5` (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human asked for a step-by-step guide in `_docs` with more detail than the bullet points, including where to run each command; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_docs/push-check-image-guide.md`; this log
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none. The guide was written from `environments.md`, the `pre-push` script, the Dockerfile and QA's command list (comment 6357004988). None of its commands was run: there is no Docker here, and the sandbox's `git remote` setup was not checked. No QA
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none

### 2026-10-23 — Software Engineer: #76 asset registration and repository ingestion

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #76 (S1 task 4); issue not closed, QA not run
- agent role: Software Engineer subagent, local sandbox on `main`
- model: `claude-sonnet-5-5` (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the orchestrator's instruction to implement #76 from the PM grooming comment 6357191954 and correction 6357691953, with the human's decisions D1-D7 (dependencies `httpx` and `packaging` already committed by the human; token `GITHUB_READ_TOKEN`; interim scan status; `Scan` row as the job; `local_packages`; unguarded `POST /assets`; Makefile diff returned, not committed); no new key prompt saved
- files changed: commits a6a342f (parsers), 6ba1cae (reader, hand-written fixtures, recorder, `.env.example`, MANIFEST), 1d7c25f (scan and worker), c5ef99b (`POST /assets`, `main.py`, `tests/test_smoke.py` route assertion); this log. `Makefile` and `AGENTS.md` not edited (proposed Makefile diff returned)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify BASE=fb33f75` PASS WITH WARNINGS (62 frontend + 240 backend tests; the warnings are the one rewritten smoke assertion `paths == {}` -> `paths == {"/assets"}` and new fixture files). No live GitHub call was made; the fixtures are hand-written. Reader endpoints and header names are unverified (VERIFY markers in `github.py`)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none. Commands that required approval: none

### 2026-10-23 — Software Engineer: #76 follow-up after QA PASS

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #76 follow-up (QA risk 1 and doc notes); issue not closed
- agent role: Software Engineer subagent, local sandbox on `main`
- model: `claude-sonnet-5-5` (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the orchestrator's two-task follow-up (make `read_file` and the include check agree; apply the `testing.md` and `architecture.md` notes); no new key prompt saved
- files changed: commit 9a7950d (`github.py`, `scan.py`, `tests/test_github_reader.py`, `tests/test_ingest.py`); commit c3f5a46 (`_docs/testing.md`, `_docs/architecture.md`); this log
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make backend-test` 246 passed; `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (62 frontend + 246 backend tests; warnings are the fixture files changed since origin/main, none touched in this follow-up). No reviewer run. After QA FAIL (comment 6359044871) the fixture-layout note in `_docs/testing.md` was corrected to the real `<owner>__<repo>/contents/<path>` layout
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none. Commands that required approval: none

### 2026-10-23 — Orchestrator: #76 asset registration and repository ingestion, close-out

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #76 (task 4), orchestration: PM grooming, Engineer, QA twice, decision point, close-out
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session) with PM, Software Engineer and QA subagents
- model: `claude-sonnet-5-5` (Claude Code) for the orchestrator and all subagents
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to start the next task that would not interfere with #112, then to pause after grooming, then to continue; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `fb33f75` (dependencies), `95eb7bf` (`Makefile`, protected), `_session-summaries/issue-076-asset-ingestion.md`, `_docs/roadmap.md` check-in; this log entry. The Engineer's commits are recorded in its own entries
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): QA FAIL once on a wrong fixture-layout line in `_docs/testing.md` (comment 6359044871), then QA PASS at `2f54435` (comment 6359063365); `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (62 frontend + 246 backend tests); `make assert-clean` PASS after each QA run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved `httpx` and `packaging`, the exact `Makefile` diff (record 6358822028), the fixes at the decision point, and the held `AGENTS.md` line. I added the dependencies myself and ran the lock. Commands that required approval: `make backend-lock` and `make backend-install` (network, new dependencies); `HUMAN_APPROVED=1 git commit` for `Makefile` (protected file); `make issue-comment` and `make issue-close` (ask rules)

### 2026-10-23 — Orchestrator: #112 close-out on the human's report

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #112 (push-check image), closing after the human's image steps
- agent role: Orchestrator (main session), no subagent
- model: `claude-sonnet-5-5` (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's message that the real push, the broken-install check and the report-back "all worked fine"; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `_session-summaries/issue-112-push-check-image.md`, `_docs/roadmap.md` check-in; this log entry
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none run by me. The image steps were run by the human, who gave no output, so versions, image size and the offline `uvx` result are not recorded. QA's earlier PASS covered the static criteria only (comment 6357004988)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human ran the image steps themselves. Commands that required approval: `make issue-comment` and `make issue-close` (ask rules)

### 2026-10-23 — Software Engineer: #116 README audience and outcome positioning

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #116 (README audience and outcome in "The problem"); issue not closed
- agent role: Software Engineer subagent, local sandbox on `main`
- model: `claude-sonnet-5-5` (Claude Code)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the orchestrator's instruction to implement #116 with the human's three decisions (audience option 1, submission-build claims only, extend "The problem"); no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `README.md` (one audience paragraph and a five-item outcome list added before "VulnTriage addresses that gap"); this log
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` PASS WITH WARNINGS (62 frontend + 246 backend tests; the one warning is `tests/fixtures/github/repositories.txt`, modified before this task and not staged). README grep for Dependabot, alerts, unlike, better than, instead of, available, works today and years showed only pre-existing text and the new "alert fires" line. No reviewer run
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none. Commands that required approval: none

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #77 (task 5) OSV matching and fixed-version resolution

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #77 (task 5): OSV matching, fixed-version resolution, finding creation
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to review the roadmap and work the next issue, noting data from `make record-fixtures SOURCE=github` is present; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: new `backend/vulntriage/ingest/{versions,osv_ranges,osv,matcher}.py`; edits to `backend/vulntriage/ingest/scan.py` and `backend/vulntriage/worker.py` (inject an optional OSV client; replace the interim status rule with the OSV result; add the E3 `feed unavailable` path); new `tests/osv_stub.py` and tests `tests/test_{versions,osv_ranges,osv_client,matcher}.py`; edits to `tests/test_ingest.py` (updated the two interim tests, added the `I-FINDINGS` scan-to-findings case); extended `tests/record_fixtures.py` with `SOURCE=osv`; new `tests/fixtures/osv/` (querybatch, four vuln advisories, packages.txt, README); `tests/fixtures/MANIFEST.md` rows; this log entry
- new dependencies: none. npm SemVer 2.0.0 precedence is implemented in-house in `versions.py` (a SemVer library is approval-gated); PyPI ordering uses `packaging`, already a dependency
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY with no PyPI access, so `uv sync`, `make install`, `make test` and `make verify` could NOT be run here. All changed/new Python files byte-compile under CPython 3.12.13. The two pure algorithms were validated standalone against the spec examples and edge cases: SemVer 2.0.0 precedence (semver.org §11.4 chain, leading `v`, numeric vs string); and the five-step fixed-version rule loaded from the real `osv_ranges`/`versions` modules (spec example 1.2.0→1.2.5 and 2.0.0→2.0.1, open-ended and last_affected-only → no fixed version, overlapping intervals → lowest value outside every containing interval, urllib3 merged-advisory case → 1.26.17). The alias union-find grouping was validated standalone (two advisories sharing a CVE → one group; a bridging advisory → one group). The full pytest suite still needs a run by the human on a networked machine (or CI) before merge
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): pending. The human should run `make install && make verify` (push-check image `vulntriage-push-check:1`) before merging; the `Makefile` was not edited so no protected-path approval was needed

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #78 (task 6) KEV and EPSS enrichment

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #78 (task 6): CISA KEV and FIRST EPSS signal enrichment per finding CVE
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to work the next issue in the plan after #77 merged; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: new `backend/vulntriage/ingest/signals.py` (KEV + EPSS clients and `enrich_asset`); edits to `backend/vulntriage/ingest/scan.py` and `backend/vulntriage/worker.py` (optional KEV/EPSS clients threaded through `run_scan`/`run_pending_scans`/`ScanWorker`; enrichment runs after matching and never changes the OSV scan status, E3); new `tests/signals_stub.py` and `tests/test_signals.py` (U-KEV, U-EPSS, U-FEED); `tests/test_ingest.py` (I-FINDINGS extended to assert KEV/EPSS flow through a scan); `tests/test_github_reader.py` (recorder tests updated now that kev/epss are implemented); `tests/record_fixtures.py` extended with `SOURCE=kev`/`epss`; new `tests/fixtures/kev/`, `tests/fixtures/epss/`, `tests/fixtures/cves.txt`; `tests/fixtures/MANIFEST.md` rows; this log entry
- new dependencies: none
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY with no PyPI access, so `make install`/`make test`/`make verify` could NOT be run here. All changed/new files byte-compile under CPython 3.12.13; the KEV/EPSS fixtures parse and the signal parse helpers (date/float, catalogue membership, EPSS filtering) and `kev_value` derivation were validated standalone. The full pytest suite needs a run by the human on a networked machine (or CI) before merge
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): pending. The human should run `make install && make verify BASE=origin/main` before merging; the `Makefile` was not edited, so no protected-path approval was needed. VERIFY: the KEV catalogue URL/fields and the EPSS `cve=` batch size/fields are marked in `signals.py`; confirm with a live `make record-fixtures SOURCE=kev` / `SOURCE=epss`

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #79 (task 7) deterministic ranking and rank reason

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #79 (task 7): deterministic tier, total order and rank reason per finding
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to work the next issue in the plan after #78 merged; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: new `backend/vulntriage/ingest/ranking.py` (pure `tier_for`, `sort_key`, `order_findings` and the DB-writing `rank_asset`); edit to `backend/vulntriage/ingest/scan.py` (run `rank_asset` after enrichment, replacing the placeholder rank fields from task 5); new `tests/test_ranking.py` (U-TIER, U-TIE, the I-RANK worked example, and a DB `rank_asset` case); `tests/test_ingest.py` (I-FINDINGS asserts the scan's tiers); this log entry
- new dependencies: none; no new threshold or enum beyond architecture § Prioritisation (T = 0.10, A16-A18)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY with no PyPI access, so `make install`/`make test`/`make verify` could NOT be run here. All changed/new files byte-compile under CPython 3.12.13; the pure ranking logic (all four tier rules, the 0.10 inclusive threshold, the P1-first precedence, and the architecture worked example order `fnd-0001, 0002, 0004, 0005, 0003, 0006`) was validated standalone. The full pytest suite needs a run by the human on a networked machine (or CI) before merge
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): pending. The human should run `make install && make verify BASE=origin/main` before merging; the `Makefile` was not edited, so no protected-path approval was needed

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #80 (task 8) finding lifecycle, re-scan and audit trail

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #80 (task 8): re-scan status transitions (fixed/withdrawn/reopen/restore) and the audit trail
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to work the next issue in the plan after #79 merged; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: new `backend/vulntriage/ingest/lifecycle.py` (the status machine, lifecycle creation and append-only audit writes); `backend/vulntriage/ingest/matcher.py` refactored so `match_asset` reconciles every (asset, package, vulnerability) on each scan — grouping withdrawn advisories too, lazy vulnerability upsert so a withdrawn-at-first-sight advisory records nothing (E4), and closing findings OSV no longer returns; `backend/vulntriage/ingest/ranking.py` sets the E8 `signals_changed` flag on a risk-accepted finding whose tier rises or KEV becomes listed; new `tests/test_lifecycle.py` (US-10, E4 withdraw/restore, E7 reopen, E8 close, audit trail) with a programmable OSV client; `tests/test_ranking.py` E8 flag test; this log entry
- new dependencies: none
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY with no PyPI access, so `make install`/`make test`/`make verify` could NOT be run here. All changed/new files byte-compile under CPython 3.12.13; the full lifecycle state machine (US-10 fix, E4 withdraw/restore, E7 reopen, E8 close) was validated standalone against every transition. The full pytest suite needs a run by the human on a networked machine (or CI) before merge
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): pending. The human should run `make install && make verify BASE=origin/main` before merging; the `Makefile` was not edited, so no protected-path approval was needed

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #80 follow-up, two fixes from the human's make verify run

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #80 (task 8), after the human ran `make install && make verify` (6 failed, 319 passed)
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session), on `feat/80-lifecycle-rescan-audit`
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given: the human pasted the failing `make verify` output
- files changed: `backend/vulntriage/ingest/scan.py` (clear `finding_dependencies` links to the old dependency rows before the per-scan `DELETE FROM dependencies`, so a re-scan with existing findings does not trip the foreign key — a real production bug, not only a test bug); `backend/vulntriage/ingest/ranking.py` (the first ranking, with empty `rank_inputs`, is a baseline and no longer sets `signals_changed`); `tests/test_lifecycle.py` (the `_set_version` helper mirrors the scan worker's link-clearing); `tests/test_ranking.py` unchanged in intent; this log entry
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the human's run reported 319 passed and 6 failed before these fixes; the failures were the FK violation on re-scan (5 cases) and the spurious first-rank escalation (1 case). Re-run still owed to the human — the Kiro Web sandbox has no PyPI access, so I could not run `make verify` here; the changed files byte-compile under CPython 3.12.13
- human review: pending re-run of `make verify BASE=origin/main`

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #81 (task 9a) session authentication and CSRF guard

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #81 (task 9a): session cookie auth, CSRF header guard, login lockout, owner-match rule
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to work the next issue after #80 merged, then "approve recommendation" for the Argon2id dependency; no new key prompt saved
- new dependencies: `argon2-cffi` added to `backend/pyproject.toml` with the human's explicit approval (Option A) for Argon2id password hashing (architecture § Security boundaries A30). `backend/uv.lock` is NOT yet updated — the sandbox has no PyPI access, so the human must run `make backend-lock` (then `make backend-install`) before `make verify`
- files changed: new `backend/vulntriage/api/security.py` (Argon2id hash/verify, session create/resolve/delete with hashed 256-bit ids and 30-min idle / 8-hour absolute lifetimes, the `vt_session` cookie flags, the in-process login lockout, the CSRF + wrong-consumer `require_session` guard, and the A30 owner-match helper); new `backend/vulntriage/api/auth.py` (`POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/logout`, `GET /auth/me`); `backend/vulntriage/main.py` (register the auth router, the login-throttle app state, and an HTTPException handler that renders the contract `{code, message}` Error shape); `backend/pyproject.toml` (`argon2-cffi`); new `tests/test_api_auth.py` (I-AUTH-SESSION and the guard cases); this log entry
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY (no PyPI, no argon2/fastapi installed), so `make install`/`make test`/`make verify` could NOT be run here. All changed/new files byte-compile under CPython 3.12.13; the dependency-free logic (login-lockout sliding window and expiry, the owner-match trim/case-fold rule, and the session-token hashing) was validated standalone. The full pytest suite needs a run by the human after `make backend-lock`
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved adding `argon2-cffi`. Pending: `make backend-lock && make backend-install && make verify BASE=origin/main`. The `Makefile` was not edited, so no protected-path approval was needed

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #82 (task 9b) findings, assets, re-scan and risk-acceptance API

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #82 (task 9b): the frontend resource endpoints behind the session guard
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to work the next issue after #81 merged; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: new `backend/vulntriage/api/findings.py` (`GET /findings`, `GET /findings/{id}`, `POST /findings/{id}/risk-acceptance`); new `backend/vulntriage/api/serializers.py` (the Finding/FindingWithAsset wire shape: aliases, derived KEV/EPSS, dependency entries, affected-range projection, audit trail, joined asset); `backend/vulntriage/api/assets.py` (guarded `POST /assets` with session + security-lead; added `GET /assets`, `GET /assets/{id}`, `PATCH /assets/{id}` with per-field audit + re-score, `POST /assets/{id}/rescan`; `asset_to_wire` now shows the latest scan's warnings); `backend/vulntriage/ingest/ranking.py` (`ranked_findings` for the server rank order); `backend/vulntriage/main.py` (register the findings router); new `tests/auth_helpers.py`; updated `tests/test_api_assets.py` (authenticate as a security lead with CSRF) and `tests/test_smoke.py` (route set); new `tests/test_api_findings.py` (I-RISK + reads + error-order + owner-match); this log entry
- new dependencies: none (argon2-cffi was added in #81)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY (no PyPI, no fastapi/argon2 installed), so `make install`/`make test`/`make verify` could NOT be run here. All changed/new files byte-compile under CPython 3.12.13; the affected-range projection was validated standalone. The contract's error order (risk acceptance: 404 then owner-403 then 422; registerAsset/updateAsset: role-403 before body-422) is enforced by reading the raw body and validating it after the earlier checks, instead of via a pydantic body param. The full pytest suite needs a run by the human (and will exercise the `test_api_assets.py` guard changes)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): pending `make verify BASE=origin/main`. The `Makefile` was not edited, so no protected-path approval was needed

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #83 (task 10a) service API and notification jobs

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #83 (task 10a): n8n/responder service operations, top-tier job creation, showcase stubs
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)

- new dependencies: none
- submission vs showcase: only the `top tier` job kind is created for submission (keyed `(lifecycle, "top tier")`); `signals changed`/reminder/escalation/digest/issue-close job creation, the n8n claim/report/digest behaviour, and the MCP tools are Showcase, present here only as contract-only stubs so task-14 conformance can compare every operation. The delivery worker (claim/email/sent/failed) is task 37; the daily scheduler is task 38
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY (no PyPI/fastapi/argon2), so `make install`/`make test`/`make verify` could NOT be run here. All changed/new files byte-compile under CPython 3.12.13; the service-auth decision table, the A27 due dates, the idempotency key and the traceparent format were validated standalone. The full pytest suite needs a run by the human
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): pending `make verify BASE=origin/main`. `.env.example` left unchanged: the n8n/MCP tokens are Showcase and the responder token arrives with task 28, per `tasks.md`. The `Makefile` was not edited, so no protected-path approval was needed

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #84 (task 10b) MCP and responder read APIs

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #84 (task 10b): the three MCP read operations and getAsset's dual consumer; responder reads confirmed
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to work the next task after #83 merged; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `backend/vulntriage/api/service.py` (replaced the three MCP stubs with real reads: `GET /mcp/top-exposures` → `RankedFinding[]` open-only in rank order with `limit` 1-50 and `assetId` filter/404; `GET /mcp/vulnerabilities/{id}/assets` → `AffectedAssets` resolving any alias, known/unknown distinguishable; `GET /mcp/findings/{id}` → `McpFinding` = FindingWithAsset + labelled `untrustedAdvisoryData`); `backend/vulntriage/api/serializers.py` (new `untrusted_advisory_data`, `ranked_finding_to_wire`, the fixed `UNTRUSTED_LABEL`); `backend/vulntriage/api/service_auth.py` (new `require_session_or_mcp` for the shared `getAsset`); `backend/vulntriage/api/assets.py` (`GET /assets/{id}` now accepts a session cookie OR the MCP token); new `tests/test_api_mcp.py`; this log entry
- new dependencies: none
- submission vs showcase: the MCP operations are Showcase (the MCP server with its four tools is task 32), built here as the read API so the task-14 conformance test and the US-12 untrusted-data boundary hold. The responder read ops were already built in #83 (task 10a) and are re-covered by their tests. No write tool exists; every write with the MCP token is 403
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY (no PyPI/fastapi), so `make install`/`make test`/`make verify` could NOT be run here. All changed/new files byte-compile under CPython 3.12.13. The full pytest suite needs a run by the human
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): pending `make verify BASE=origin/main`. `.env.example` unchanged (MCP token is Showcase). The `Makefile` was not edited, so no protected-path approval was needed

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #85 (task 11) frontend dashboard read views

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #85 (task 11): the dashboard read views for assets and ranked findings
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to work the next issue after #84 merged; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `frontend/src/test/vulntriage.test.tsx` (added the `F-ASSET` and `F-STATUS` describe blocks that render the real `/assets`, `/findings` and `/findings/{id}` screens and assert US-1, US-4, US-5 and US-6 against the services layer); this log entry
- what was already present: the dashboard read views, components and services/types layer were built by the #34/#45 SPA-shell work (`routes/_authed.assets.index.tsx`, `_authed.findings.index.tsx`, `_authed.findings.$findingId.tsx`, `components/vt/*`, `services/*`). #85 confirms they meet the US-1/4/5/6 acceptance criteria and adds the named `F-ASSET`/`F-STATUS` cases the test strategy calls for; no new view code or dependency was needed
- new dependencies: none (used the existing services layer and types)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY — the npm registry is blocked (registry.npmjs.org 403), so `npm ci`, `make frontend-test` and `make frontend-typecheck` could NOT be run here. The new tests use only symbols already imported in the suite and assert against the existing components' real markup (verified by reading `FindingsTable.tsx`, `Badges.tsx`, the asset/finding routes and `mockData.ts`: `formatEpss(null)` is `"EPSS: n/a"`, the status label text, the `asset-owner`/`asset-scan`/`rank-reason`/`brief-pending`/`brief-unavailable` test ids). The full frontend suite + type check need a run by the human
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): pending `make verify` (runs the frontend suite and type check). The `Makefile` was not edited, so no protected-path approval was needed

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #86 (task 12) risk acceptance, audit trail and re-scan UI

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #86 (task 12): the dashboard write path — accept risk, audit trail, manual re-scan
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to work the next task after #85 merged; no new key prompt saved
- files changed: `frontend/src/test/vulntriage.test.tsx` (added the `F-STATUS write path` describe block covering US-10 and US-11 through the real accept form, the assets re-scan button and the AuditTrail component); this log entry
- what was already present: the write views were built by the #34/#45 SPA shell — the accept-risk form (`routes/_authed.findings.$findingId_.accept.tsx`), the `AuditTrail` component, the per-row re-scan button (`routes/_authed.assets.index.tsx`), `validateRiskReason`, and the mock `acceptRisk`/`reScan` with the contract error order (401, 404, owner-403, 422, 409), the who/when/previous/reason audit entry, and no automated `risk accepted`. #86 confirms US-10/US-11 and adds the named write-path coverage; no view or service code changed
- new dependencies: none
- CSRF note: the custom CSRF header (`X-Requested-With`) is a concern of the real API-backed `Services` implementation (built later); the mock services layer has no HTTP, so it enforces only the error-to-`ServiceError` mapping and the behaviour. Recorded as a VERIFY for the real client
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox blocks the npm registry (`registry.npmjs.org` 403), so `npm ci`, `make frontend-test` and `make frontend-typecheck` could NOT be run here. The new tests use only symbols already imported in the suite and assert via `getByRole`/`getByLabelText`/direct service state (avoiding the ambiguous-text pitfall from #85), checked against the real `accept` route, `AuditTrail.tsx`, assets route and `mockService.ts`. The full frontend suite + type check need a run by the human. `I-RISK` (the backend half) already passes from #82
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): pending `make verify`. The `Makefile` was not edited, so no protected-path approval was needed

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #87 (task 13) backend test layers and stored fixtures

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #87 (task 13): consolidate the backend unit and SQLite integration test layers, fixtures and manifest
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to work the next task after #86 merged; no new key prompt saved
- what was already present: tasks 1-12 built the harness incrementally — the network guard with `U-NET`/`I-NET` (`tests/test_network_guard.py`), all stubs (`github_stub`, `osv_stub`, `signals_stub`, `conftest`), the github/osv/kev/epss fixtures, `tests/record_fixtures.py` (`SOURCE=github|osv|kev|epss`), `tests/fixtures/MANIFEST.md`, and `make test` already running the backend suite after the frontend suite
- files changed: added a module-level `pytestmark` (`unit` or `sqlite_integration`) to the 10 test files that had none, so every `U-*`/SQLite `I-*` case is selectable by marker for the task-21 CI split: `test_github_reader.py`, `test_parser_package_lock.py`, `test_parser_requirements.py`, `test_parser_uv_lock.py` (unit); `test_api_assets.py`, `test_api_auth.py`, `test_api_findings.py`, `test_api_mcp.py`, `test_api_service.py`, `test_ingest.py` (sqlite_integration). `backend/pyproject.toml` gained `addopts = "--strict-markers"` (an unknown marker is now an error; it does not require a mark). Files with existing per-test marks (`test_db_*`, `test_network_guard`, `test_ranking`, `test_smoke`, and the already-marked modules) were left as they were. This log entry and the session summary
- new dependencies: none
- scope: this is a harness/fixtures consolidation task. The `U-*`/SQLite `I-*` cases for tasks 1-12 are implemented; checks that belong to later tasks (I-CONTRACT task 14, I-SCHED task 38, I-OWNER-* task 37, the Showcase I-* cases) stay with those tasks. The task's own check is "`make test` passes with both layers; `make verify` passes"
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY (no PyPI), so `make test`/`make verify` could NOT be run here. All test files byte-compile under CPython 3.12.13; the marker coverage was audited (every file resolves to `unit`, `sqlite_integration` or a correct mix), the MANIFEST was confirmed to name every captured fixture with a source and capture date, and `--strict-markers` was confirmed not to require a mark (only to reject an unknown one). The full suite needs a run by the human
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): pending `make verify`. The `Makefile` was not edited (so no protected-path approval); `backend/pyproject.toml` is not protected

### 2026-10-23 — Agent: #88 (task 14) OpenAPI conformance and validation

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: #88 (task 14): the I-CONTRACT conformance test comparing FastAPI's generated document with _docs/openapi.yaml
- agent role: implementation agent (Kiro Web session, local sandbox on `main`)
- model: Auto (server-selected)
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the human's instruction to work the next task after #87 merged, then "approve recommendation option a" for the conformance granularity; no new key prompt saved
- decision: Option A (human-approved). The hand-built routes (raw-body parsing, dict returns, Depends guards) emit no declared query/header params, no request/response schemas and no security block, so a deep schema compare against app.openapi() is impossible and making the routes conformant is tasks 9b/10a/10b (out of scope). The test compares the dimensions the routes actually express: the path set (template variables normalised so the contract's {id} matches FastAPI's {finding_id}), the method set per path, the success status code per operation, and the security requirement per operation checked against the Depends guard wired on the route (mapping require_session->cookieAuth, require_session_or_mcp->cookieAuth+mcpAuth, require_n8n->n8nAuth, require_mcp->mcpAuth, require_responder->responderAuth, no guard->public). GET /health is excluded by name
- files changed: new `tests/test_openapi_conformance.py` (the comparison, a strict scoped reader of the contract's paths block with no new YAML dependency, the /health-exclusion test, an extra-route-fails test, and a deliberate-mismatch test that flips login's 2xx status in a copy); this log entry
- new dependencies: none (the contract paths block is read by a small strict parser, not a YAML library)
- ignored fields (named per the acceptance criteria): title, description, summary, operationId, examples; and — because the current routes do not declare them — query/header parameters, request/response body schemas and the non-2xx responses. VERIFY: a full schema/response/declared-security conformance test needs response_model and declared parameters/security on every route (a task-9b/10 change)
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY (no PyPI/fastapi), so `make test`/`make verify` could NOT be run here. The test byte-compiles under CPython 3.12.13; the strict contract parser was run standalone against the real _docs/openapi.yaml and extracted exactly 22 operations with the right status codes (16x200, 3x202, 2x204, 1x201) and security counts (cookieAuth 9, mcpAuth 4, n8nAuth 6, responderAuth 2; login/logout public), which cross-checks the generated side's guard counts. The full suite needs a run by the human; `make openapi-validate` is unchanged (the contract was not edited)
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved Option A. Pending `make verify`. The `Makefile` and `_docs/openapi.yaml` were not edited (openapi.yaml is read-only here), so no protected-path approval was needed

#### 2026-10-23 — follow-up: #88 conformance test fix after first `make verify`

- The human's first `make verify` run of PR #130 reported 383 passed, 5 failed: the 5 new conformance tests failed because `_generated_ops()` returned an empty set. Root cause: the generated side identified routes by the `APIRoute` class (`isinstance(route, APIRoute)`), which matched zero routes at the granularity the test iterated.
- Fix (commit `bf3b633` on `feat/88-openapi-conformance`): the generated side now takes the path set, method set and success status from `app.openapi()["paths"]` — the document the test exists to check and the same source `test_smoke` reads successfully — and reads the security requirement off each route's `Depends` guard, matching routes to openapi operations by normalised path + method. Guards are found by duck-typing (`path` + `methods` + `dependant`), not by class identity. Removed the now-unused `from fastapi.routing import APIRoute` import; the two inline helper tests (`/health` exclusion, extra-route-fails) now reuse `_generated_ops(app)`.
- Cross-check (standalone, since the sandbox has no PyPI/fastapi): the backend declares exactly 22 route operations with status codes 1×201, 3×202, 2×204, 16×200, and guard counts require_session 8, require_session_or_mcp 1, require_n8n 6, require_mcp 3, require_responder 2 (→ cookieAuth 9, mcpAuth 4, n8nAuth 6, responderAuth 2; login/logout public). These match the contract parser's 22 ops and the recorded status/security tallies, so the generated and contract sides reconcile.
- verification: still pending the human's `make verify` (sandbox cannot run the fastapi suite). The file byte-compiles under CPython 3.12.13 and carries no trailing whitespace.

#### 2026-10-23 — follow-up 2: #88 guard detection for GET /auth/me

- With the `openapi()`-derived generated side in place, the second `make verify` run passed path/method/status for all 22 operations and left a single failure: `('/auth/me', 'get')` reported no guard schemes (`set()`) against the contract's `{cookieAuth}`. `/auth/me` is guarded by `Depends(require_session)` like the other cookie routes, but `_guard_schemes()` scanned only the route dependant's top-level `dependencies` and missed it there.
- Fix (commit `48789b2`): `_guard_schemes()` now walks the entire `dependant` tree — the root dependant plus every sub-dependency, with an `id()`-based cycle guard — so a guard call is found at whatever depth FastAPI nests it. The scheme map and the rest of the test are unchanged.
- verification: pending the human's next `make verify` (the sandbox has no fastapi, so this cannot be run here). The file byte-compiles under CPython 3.12.13 and has no trailing whitespace.

#### 2026-10-23 — follow-up 3: #88 guard read from the endpoint signature

- The recursive dependant-tree walk still returned no schemes for `GET /auth/me`, so the guard is simply not reachable via `route.dependant.dependencies` the way the other cookie routes' guards are (that route takes the guard as a value, `user: User = Depends(require_session)`, with no `Request` parameter; the already-passing routes all take `request: Request` plus the guard).
- Fix (commit `8d8d31b`): read guards from the source of truth — the endpoint function signature. Each parameter whose default is a FastAPI `Depends` marker exposes the dependency callable on `.dependency`; the reader collects any whose `__name__` is a known guard and recurses into dependency callables (cycle-guarded). The dependant-tree walk is kept as a backstop for router- or decorator-level `dependencies=[...]` that do not appear in the endpoint signature. Added `import inspect`.
- verification: pending the human's next `make verify`. The file byte-compiles under CPython 3.12.13 and has no trailing whitespace. If this still misses `/auth/me`, the next step is a one-off diagnostic (printing the route's dependant tree and signature) run in the devcontainer, since the sandbox cannot import fastapi.

#### 2026-10-23 — follow-up 4: #88 route walk through FastAPI's own route iterator

- agent role: implementation agent (Claude Code cloud session, on `feat/88-openapi-conformance`)
- model: see the session record (not recorded in the repository)
- Root cause: the locked FastAPI (0.161.1) does not copy included routes onto `app.routes`; `include_router` adds one `_IncludedRouter` per router, whose routes live on `.original_router.routes` (not `.routes`). The diagnostic run in the devcontainer showed `app.routes` holding only the four docs routes plus four `_IncludedRouter` objects, so the guard map was empty for every API route. The earlier "only `/auth/me` fails" reading was the guard test stopping at its first failing assertion, not 21 routes passing.
- Fix: `_route_guards()` now walks the app with `fastapi.routing.iter_route_contexts(app.routes)`, the iterator `app.openapi()` itself uses, which yields each effective route with its full path, methods and `original_route` (endpoint and `dependant`). Removed the hand-written `_iter_leaf_routes()` and the TEMP `test_DIAG_dump_guard_map`; kept `test_the_route_tree_is_flattened_and_guards_are_read` as the regression test.
- verification: `tests/test_openapi_conformance.py` 7 passed; `make verify` passed (389 tests, type check, whitespace, weakened-test check).

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: task 2 (#75) — planning evidence and tracker hygiene

- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked to close out S1 by completing task 2 and to add a step-by-step local end-to-end verification guide under `_docs/`.
- files changed: `_docs/tasks.md` (evidence note under task 2 only), `_docs/verify-locally.md` (new local verification guide), `README.md` (index link), `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry).
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` NOT run — the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY (no PyPI/npm), so dependencies cannot be installed here. The task 2 change is documentation only. CI on `main` is green at the time of writing (latest run success at `b007833`). The human must run `make verify` on a networked machine before relying on it.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Follow-up recorded in `_docs/verify-locally.md` and the task-2 note: `make dev` / `dev-start` / `dev-stop` (task 11 / #85 acceptance) are not in the Makefile and should be filed as a follow-up.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: Tier B review, documentation tidy-up and Milestone B grooming (step 12 for Milestone B)

- agent role: PM + doc tidy (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked to review the Tier B roadmap for missing planning, tidy the spread-out/confusing docs, then groom the Tier B tasks into issue proposals with a "PM confirm with human" note (no issues filed yet).
- files changed: `_docs/tier-b-build.md` (new consolidated Tier B build sheet), `_docs/roadmap.md` (S1 status -> done; D-numbering disambiguation note), `README.md` (index link to the build sheet), `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-23-tier-b-grooming.md` (new grooming proposal, 8 issues with acceptance criteria and PM->human confirm blocks), `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry).
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): docs only; no code changed. `make verify` not run (sandbox has no npm/PyPI; nothing to test). Assessment grounded in tasks.md, architecture.md, testing.md and roadmap.md.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. The grooming doc is a proposal; issues are not filed and await the human's confirmation of the open points. Also flagged separately: PR #135 is needed because the #133 work did not reach `main` via the earlier PR chain.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: #133 — add make dev / dev-start / dev-stop and wire the frontend to the backend (completes task 11's single-command Tier A run)

- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked to implement #133 (option A): real fetch service against the existing contract plus the make dev targets, so make dev runs end-to-end.
- files changed: `frontend/src/services/httpService.ts` (new real fetch service), `frontend/src/services/index.ts` (bind services to httpServices; keep mock as a fixture), `frontend/vite.config.ts` (dev server API proxy, one origin), `frontend/src/test/vulntriage.test.tsx` (vi.mock @/services so route-render tests use the mock), `frontend/src/test/http-service.test.ts` (new: cookie, CSRF, 403->forbidden), `Makefile` (dev/dev-start/dev-stop; PROTECTED, human-approved), `AGENTS.md` (Commands: make dev; PROTECTED, human-approved), `_docs/verify-locally.md` (make dev is now the primary path), `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry).
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): `make verify` NOT run — the Kiro Web sandbox is network-mode INTEGRATIONS_ONLY (no npm/PyPI), so the frontend suite and type check cannot run here. The human must run `make verify` (and a manual `make dev` end-to-end check) on a networked machine before merge; CI on the PR runs the frontend tests.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the Makefile and AGENTS.md (protected) changes in this session before the commit.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: #31 (T3) — Compose-based dev container so Postgres runs as a sibling service

- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked to pick up #31 and approved: add psycopg[binary], keep the write/restart/read persistence test as #68, use a Compose dev container with a small app Dockerfile.
- files changed: `.devcontainer/compose.yaml` (new; app + pinned postgres:16.4 `db` sibling, no docker.sock, workspace-only host mount, pgdata named volume, healthcheck), `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` (new; python:3.12 app image), `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (converted from single `image` to Compose: dockerComposeFile/service/runServices/workspaceFolder; DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://vt:vt@db:5432/vt), `backend/pyproject.toml` (add psycopg[binary]>=3.2,<4; human-approved), `AGENTS.md` (protected: Environment line + the Docker gotcha, human-approved), `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry), session summary.
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): NOT run here. The Kiro Web sandbox is read-only for uv's Python dir and has no PyPI, so `uv lock`, `make backend-lock`, `make backend-test` and the Docker rebuild cannot run. The human must, during the rebuild: run `make backend-lock` (psycopg is a new dependency, so `uv.lock` must be regenerated before `uv sync --locked`), rebuild the dev container, then run `make backend-test` with `DATABASE_URL` set to the `db` service and quote the result. The dedicated write/restart/read persistence test stays #68.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved psycopg[binary], the #68 scope split, and the Compose-devcontainer + app Dockerfile approach before the build; the protected AGENTS.md diff is approved in-session before its HUMAN_APPROVED commit.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: Milestone B issues filed (#137-#144) after human confirmation of the grooming proposal

- agent role: PM (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human confirmed the grooming proposal: file now, AWS account + Budgets ready so no D5 fallback date needed, security-scan tools and Terraform approved.
- files changed: filed 8 GitHub issues #137-#144 (tasks 15-22); updated `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-23-tier-b-grooming.md` (status FILED with the numbers), `_docs/roadmap.md` (check-in log line), `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry).
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none; grooming/doc work only. Issue bodies follow the Milestone A house style (Goal / Acceptance criteria / Out of scope / Constraints); no milestone or label set, matching the Milestone A convention.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the grooming open points before filing.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: #137 (task 15) — one-command Compose stack, incl. the /api prefix move (Option B
 
- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked to start #137, then (on hitting the SPA/API path collision) preferred Option B and asked for an impact analysis + proposal before changes; then approved the recommendations (Option B, root_path=/api, /api/health).
- files changed: `backend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/nginx.conf`, `compose.yaml`, `backend/.dockerignore`, `frontend/.dockerignore`, `.env.example` (rewritten), `backend/vulntriage/main.py` (/health route + root_path=/api), `frontend/src/services/httpService.ts` (API_BASE=/api), `frontend/src/test/http-service.test.ts` (2 URL assertions), `frontend/vite.config.ts` (single /api proxy with rewrite), `_docs/openapi.yaml` (servers.url=/api), `_docs/api.md` (base-path + health notes), `Makefile` (compose-up/compose-down; PROTECTED, human-approved), two session summaries (#137 and the /api proposal), this log entry.
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): NOT run here — the Kiro Web sandbox has no Docker/PyPI and a read-only uv dir, so `make compose-up` and `make verify` cannot run. main.py byte-compiles. The human runs `make verify` (frontend + conformance must stay green; backend/tests unchanged by the /api move) and `make compose-up`, then hard-refreshes /findings to confirm the SPA loads.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved Option B and D1/D2 after reading the impact proposal; the protected Makefile (compose targets) is approved in-session before its HUMAN_APPROVED commit.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: #137 follow-up — document the Compose stack in _docs/verify-locally.md
  
- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked that the verify steps live in _docs/verify-locally.md.
- files changed: `_docs/verify-locally.md` (new §7 "Run the full Compose stack (phase S2)" with make compose-up, the /env setup, the /api one-origin note and the /findings hard-refresh acceptance; corrected the §6 Vite proxy note to the single /api prefix; renumbered Clean up to §8; added Compose troubleshooting rows and updated the status/scope notes), `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry).
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): docs only; no code changed. Not run (sandbox has no Docker/PyPI).
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; part of PR #147.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: #137 fixes from make verify (human-run on the branch)
- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human ran make verify on feat/137-compose-stack; it FAILED on a stale .env.example test and warned on a deprecated root_path.
- files changed: `backend/vulntriage/main.py` (drop the deprecated FastAPI(root_path="/api") — D1 was optional/cosmetic; proxy strips /api regardless), `tests/test_github_reader.py` (rewrite test_env_example_* to assert the task-15 contract: required names present, showcase names absent, no committed values), `_docs/api.md` (note the app sets no root_path), two session summaries, this log entry.
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): byte-compiled; the new env-example test logic validated standalone against the real .env.example (passes). Full pytest not runnable here (no venv/PyPI). The human re-runs make verify on the branch.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human's make verify run found both issues; this commit addresses them. No test was weakened — the env-example test now asserts a stronger, accurate contract.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: #138 (task 16) — real-Postgres integration tests
- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked to work the next task (#138) and approved the design recommendations (transaction-rollback isolation, reuse compose.yaml's db under vt-test, integration-only via the existing sqlite_integration marker, E-GUARD = vt db + compose host check).
- files changed: `tests/conftest.py` (db_engine/db_session + sqlite_* aliases, guard_test_database_url E-GUARD, Alembic upgrade in pytest_configure, VT_TEST_DATABASE_URL branch), `tests/test_integration_guard.py` (new E-GUARD unit cases), `ci/test-integration.sh` (new orchestration), `compose.test.yaml` (new test-only db port override), `Makefile` (test-integration + postgres-integration; PROTECTED, human-approved), `_docs/verify-locally.md` (§7 integration subsection), session summary, this log entry.
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): NOT fully run here — sandbox has no Docker/venv/PyPI. Python test files byte-compile; ci/test-integration.sh passes `bash -n`; the E-GUARD accept/reject decisions were cross-checked standalone (3 accept, 5 reject). The human runs `make verify` (SQLite + E-GUARD unit cases) and `make test-integration` (Postgres) on the host.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved the four design decisions before the build; the protected Makefile targets are approved in-session before the HUMAN_APPROVED commit.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: #139 (task 19) — CI test pipeline
- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked to work the next task (#139) and chose Option B (thin make targets per marker, so every CI job runs through make).
- files changed: `.github/workflows/verify.yml` (six jobs: unit, sqlite-integration, frontend, openapi-validation, postgres-integration, plus the retained verify gate), `Makefile` (test-unit / test-sqlite-integration / test-conformance; PROTECTED, human-approved), session summary, this log entry.
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): NOT run here (sandbox can't run GitHub Actions or the suite). Verified every `- run: make ...` maps to a real Makefile target, and that the unit/sqlite_integration markers partition the backend suite (no unmarked test). The human confirms on the first PR CI run.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human chose Option B over Option A (raw pytest in CI); the protected Makefile targets are approved in-session before the HUMAN_APPROVED commit.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: #138 fix — Postgres isolation switched from shared-connection rollback to fresh schema
- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): the #139 CI run exercised make test-integration for the first time; the postgres-integration job FAILED with AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'transaction_status' on 155 tests.
- files changed: `tests/conftest.py` (replace the single-shared-connection rollback with fresh-schema isolation: db_engine drop_all at setup/teardown on Postgres, each test's factory runs create_all as on SQLite; remove the Alembic _run_migrations helper and its call), `_session-summaries/issue-138-postgres-integration.md` (record the change and the reason), this log entry.
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): conftest byte-compiles; the fix removes the pooled-connection-proxy misuse that caused the AttributeError. Confirmed every sqlite_integration module builds its own schema via create_all (so fresh-schema works), except test_network_guard whose one integration case needs no tables. The human re-runs make test-integration; CI's postgres-integration job on this fix proves it.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; follow-up fix to the merged #138, discovered by #139's CI.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: Tier C build sheet (roadmapping document, like tier-b-build.md)
- agent role: PM / doc (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked to start roadmapping the Tier C build document.
- files changed: `_docs/tier-c-build.md` (new; consolidated Tier C/S4 build sheet: per-milestone C2-C9 table with task, builds, depends-on, human step/decision, criterion and done-when; the showcase C1/C4 split; the task-37-built-inside-C3 build-order note; the dependency chain; the open D4 + responder-runtime + main-branch-protection prerequisites; the score checkpoints), `README.md` (index link), this log entry.
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): docs only; no code. Grounded in roadmap.md § Tier C milestones, tasks.md tasks 23-29/37-39, architecture.md § Observability / § Responder agent / § Security boundaries, and testing.md. Points to the sources rather than restating design; adds no new precedence rule.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet. Flags that D4 (responder false-positive rule, a protected specs.md change) is still open and blocks C6, and that the responder runtime and main branch protection are human prerequisites before task 28.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: #141 (task 17) — Terraform verification runbook (written before the Terraform itself)
- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked to write up the Terraform verification steps in _docs if not already there, before writing the Terraform. Running #141 in parallel with the other agent's #140 (no file overlap: #141 adds new terraform/ and a new deploy.yml; it does not touch Makefile or verify.yml).
- files changed: `_docs/terraform-verify.md` (new: §1 static fmt/validate checks that need no AWS, §2 pre-apply security review checklist, §3 per-module apply verification, §4 the #141 dev-URL acceptance, §5 teardown verification; consolidates the Terraform checks that were scattered across architecture.md, aws-setup.md and the push-check guide), `README.md` (index link), this log entry.
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): docs only; no code yet. The runbook references real commands (terraform fmt/validate as in push-check-image-guide.md) and the aws-setup.md apply order. The Terraform modules themselves are the next step.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the runbook defines how the human verifies the modules that come next.

#### date: 2026-10-23 — task/issue: #141 (task 17) — Terraform modules + GHCR build workflow
- agent role: Engineer (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human approved the recommendations for #141 (Caddy reverse proxy, region ap-southeast-2, Secrets Manager, t3.medium, OIDC-reuse as a variable, SES deferred) and asked that the Terraform verification runbook exist in _docs first (done: _docs/terraform-verify.md).
- files changed: `terraform/README.md`, `terraform/bootstrap/*` (state bucket), `terraform/deploy-roles/*` (OIDC + dev/prod roles), `terraform/server/*` (EC2, EIP, SG, instance role, EBS+DLM snapshots, nightly-stop schedule, user-data.sh, caddy/Caddyfile), each with a terraform.tfvars.example; `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (new; build-once → tag → GHCR → record digest; dev-deploy job scaffolded for task 21), `.gitignore` (terraform state/tfvars), session summary, this log entry. No Makefile/verify.yml change (parallel with #140).
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): NOT run here — the sandbox has no AWS or Terraform. Checked: balanced braces in every .tf, .tfvars.example tracked while state/real tfvars are git-ignored, the workflow uses only GITHUB_TOKEN + the OIDC role. The human runs terraform fmt/validate and every apply per _docs/terraform-verify.md; the task's acceptance (dev sslip.io URL answers, deploy log names a digest) is a human step.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human approved Caddy and the defaults before the build; the Terraform is reviewed and applied by the human (agents never apply or hold AWS credentials).

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: Tier C (Milestone C) issue grooming — proposal, not filed
- agent role: PM (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human asked to start grooming the Tier C jobs as was done for Tier B.
- files changed: `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-23-tier-c-grooming.md` (new; 9 proposed Milestone C issues for tasks 23-29, 37, 38, 39, each with acceptance criteria from tasks.md/architecture.md/testing.md and a PM->human confirm block; filing/build order; the open D4 + responder-runtime + main-branch-protection gates on task 28; the dependency approvals), this log entry.
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): docs only; nothing filed. Grounded in the authoritative task descriptions and the Tier C design sections; mirrors the Tier B grooming format.
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): none yet; the grooming is a proposal awaiting the human's answers to the confirm blocks before any issue is filed.

- date: 2026-10-23
- task/issue: Milestone C issues filed (#154-#163) after human confirmation
- agent role: PM (Kiro, Vibe session)
- model: not recorded
- prompt or instruction given (or link to a file in `_docs/prompts/`): human confirmed the Tier C grooming and said file the issues.
- files changed: filed 10 GitHub issues #154-#163 (tasks 23-29, 37, 38, 39) in build order; updated `_session-summaries/planning-2026-10-23-tier-c-grooming.md` (status FILED with the numbers), `_docs/roadmap.md` (check-in log line), `_docs/ai-usage-log.md` (this entry).
- verification (tests run, reviewer verdict): none; grooming/doc work only. Issue bodies follow the house style (Goal / Acceptance criteria / Out of scope / Constraints); no milestone or label set, matching the Milestone A/B convention. Task 28/#160's Constraints record its gates (D4, responder runtime, main branch protection).
- human review (what I checked or corrected, or `none`): the human confirmed the grooming before filing.
