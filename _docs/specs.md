# VulnTriage product spec (Stage 1)

Status: reviewed; the 2026-10-16 review issues (#3-#8) and follow-up #41 are resolved

Source: `_docs/project-brief.md`. Criteria: `_docs/rubric.md`.
Deferred to later stages: prioritisation formula (Stage 2), LLM guardrails
(Stage 2), API contract (Stage 3), tests (Stage 4).

Scope: the stories outside the "Showcase (post-submission)" section are the
submission scope. The backend itself runs the daily refresh and the scheduled
re-scan (US-7, US-10) and delivers the top-tier owner notification (US-8). The
stories and clauses in the Showcase section are kept in full and are built
after submission.

## Defined terms

### fixed version for this dependency

The **fixed version for this dependency** is the lowest version greater than
the installed version that is outside every affected range containing the
installed version, considering all ranges and all advisories for that
vulnerability so that the upgrade clears every one. If no such version exists,
the finding has **no fixed version for this dependency**.

- An advisory with fixed versions on several release lines (for example 1.2.5
  on the 1.x line and 2.0.1 on the 2.x line): installed 1.2.0 → `1.2.5`;
  installed 2.0.0 → `2.0.1`.
- `VERIFY:` an advisory may have no `fixed` event, and two advisories for the
  same vulnerability may list different fixed versions; in both cases apply
  the rule to all ranges and all advisories.
- `VERIFY:` OSV advisories represent affected versions as ranges with
  `introduced` and `fixed` events, and the same vulnerability may have several
  ranges or several advisories.

The fixed version for this dependency is the only value the US-6 brief
guardrail compares against (US-6 is in the Showcase section).

## User stories

### US-1: Register an asset
As a security lead, I register an app/service with its owner, criticality,
and whether it is internet-facing.
- Acceptance: an asset record shows the owner's name and contact email (or an
  ownerless marker when both are unset), criticality, and internet-facing flag;
  listing assets shows all three fields.

### US-2: Dependencies read automatically
As a security lead, dependencies are picked up automatically from the asset's
GitHub repository URL, read with a read-only token scoped to repository
contents. The files read are `uv.lock`, `requirements.txt` and
`package-lock.json`; no per-package typing is needed. This GitHub repository
URL is the only ingestion mechanism in the MVP; there is no local-path or
upload option.
- Acceptance: `uv.lock` produces a dependency entry for every package,
  including transitive entries, with package name and installed version.
- Acceptance: `requirements.txt` produces a dependency entry for every direct
  requirement, with package name and installed version, or an explicit
  "version unknown" with a visible warning.
- Acceptance: `package-lock.json` produces a dependency entry for every
  package, including transitive entries, with package name and installed
  version.
- Transitive dependencies are in scope for `uv.lock` and `package-lock.json`
  (every entry). For `requirements.txt` only direct entries are in scope.

### US-3: Match vulnerabilities with fixed versions
As an asset owner, each dependency version is matched against known
vulnerabilities, showing the fixed version for this dependency when one exists.
Each finding records the vulnerability's primary id and all its alias ids (for
example GHSA, PYSEC and CVE), including aliases when the primary id is not a
CVE. (`VERIFY:` OSV advisories carry a primary id and an `aliases` list; the
primary id may not be a CVE.)
- Acceptance: a dependency with a known vulnerability shows a finding with the
  vulnerability's primary id, all its alias ids, and the fixed version for this
  dependency when one exists; a clean dependency shows no finding.

### US-4: Enrich with real-world exploit signals
As an asset owner, each finding shows CISA KEV status, FIRST EPSS score, and
the asset context (criticality, internet-facing).
- Acceptance: a finding displays exactly one KEV value, `KEV: listed` (its CVE
  is in KEV), `KEV: not listed` (its CVE was checked and is not in KEV, or KEV
  is not yet available because no KEV fetch has succeeded, shown with the
  stale marker, E3) or `KEV: n/a (no CVE)` (E11; `VERIFY:` KEV is keyed by
  CVE), an EPSS score or `n/a`, and the owning asset's criticality and
  internet-facing flag.

### US-5: Deterministic, explainable ranking
As an asset owner, findings are ranked deterministically and each finding
shows why it ranks where it does. (Formula in Stage 2; no AI involved.)
- Acceptance: re-scoring the same inputs gives the same order; each finding
  shows the reason for its rank (e.g. tier and contributing signals).

### US-6: Plain-language fix brief (moved to Showcase)
Moved unchanged to the "Showcase (post-submission)" section below.

### US-7: Daily refresh and re-score
As a security lead, the backend refreshes KEV/EPSS data daily with its own
scheduler and re-scores findings through the API. The same scheduler runs the
scheduled re-scan of every asset (US-10). No external workflow tool is
involved.
- Acceptance: after a scheduled refresh with changed feed data, affected
  findings show updated signals and ranks without manual action.
- Acceptance: the scheduled refresh and the scheduled re-scan are started by
  the backend's own scheduler, with no manual action and no external workflow
  tool.

### US-8: New top-priority finding notifies the owner
As an asset owner, a new top-priority finding notifies me. The backend
delivers the owner notification itself and records `notification.enqueue` and
`notification.deliver` for it. "New" means the first time this finding enters
the top tier in its current lifecycle. It covers a newly created finding and an
existing finding promoted into the top tier by a daily KEV/EPSS refresh. The
top tier is `P1` as defined by the Stage 2 formula, and Open question 1 is a
blocker for Stage 2 sign-off.
- Acceptance: a newly appearing top-priority finding produces exactly one
  owner notification.
- Acceptance: a finding that leaves and re-enters the top tier without being
  fixed produces no second owner notification; a finding that was `fixed` and
  reappears (E7) starts a new lifecycle and may produce at most one new
  notification.
- Acceptance: exactly one owner notification is created per finding lifecycle,
  even if the daily refresh runs twice or retries after a partial failure. The
  idempotency basis is the finding lifecycle.
- Acceptance: for an ownerless asset, the notification is held and the asset
  is flagged ownerless (E2).
- The GitHub tracker issue that this story used to open is in the Showcase
  section ("US-8 GitHub tracker issue"), with its original wording.

### US-9: Overdue reminders, escalation, weekly digest (moved to Showcase)
Moved unchanged to the "Showcase (post-submission)" section below.

### US-10: Re-scan closes fixed findings
As an asset owner, a finding closes automatically when a re-scan shows the
installed version no longer falls in any affected range.
- Acceptance: after upgrading to a version outside every affected range (for
  example 2.0.3 when the fixed version for this dependency is 2.0.1) and
  re-scanning, the finding status is `fixed` with a timestamp; if the installed
  version is still inside any affected range (even after an upgrade), the
  finding stays `open`. A finding whose advisory has been withdrawn becomes
  `withdrawn`, not `fixed` (E4).

A signed-in user may request a re-scan of an asset from the dashboard, in addition to the scheduled re-scan.

### US-11: Dashboard with status and audit trail
As a security lead, I see findings per asset with status (`open` /
`risk accepted` / `fixed` / `withdrawn`) and an audit trail; risk acceptance happens only
by a human in the dashboard. Dashboard users sign in, and the signed-in user is
recorded as "who" in every audit entry. Both the asset owner and the security
lead may set `risk accepted`. No automated component may set it. The
authentication mechanism is defined in Stage 2.

An asset owner may accept risk only on an asset whose owner email matches their signed-in email; the security lead may accept on any asset.
- Acceptance: the dashboard lists findings per asset with current status;
  changing status records who, when, and the previous value; no automated
  component sets `risk accepted`.
- Acceptance: risk acceptance records a non-empty reason in the audit entry;
  an empty or whitespace-only reason is rejected and the status does not
  change.

### US-12: Read-only assistant answers exposure questions (moved to Showcase)
Moved unchanged to the "Showcase (post-submission)" section below.

### US-13: The notification journey is instrumented
As a security lead, I can see whether a top-priority finding reached its owner,
as metrics, traces and structured logs that share one trace ID, viewable in
Grafana.
- Acceptance: one scan-to-notification journey emits a metric, a trace and a
  structured log line carrying the same trace ID; Grafana shows them side by
  side.
  No telemetry payload contains advisory text, owner contact details, repository
  URLs, lockfile content or any credential.

### US-14: An alert fires when a top-priority finding is not notified
As an asset owner, if my finding is never delivered to me, an alert fires so
someone looks at it.
- Acceptance: a top-priority finding whose notification fails or does not
  complete within the agreed window (based on the `notification.deliver`
  outcome) fires exactly one alert naming the finding; a successful
  notification fires none.

### US-15: A responder agent wakes on the alert and fixes it
A responder agent wakes on the US-14 alert, reproduces a defect in VulnTriage's
notification path (e.g. a finding with no fixed version or several advisory IDs
fails to format), fixes it, and opens a pull request with the fix
and a test; once merged, CI deploys it to dev.
- Acceptance: the undelivered finding then reaches its owner, the alert
  resolves, and the agent's actions are logged. Production promotion stays
  manual.

### US-16: n8n workflows are exported into the repo (moved to Showcase)
Moved unchanged to the "Showcase (post-submission)" section below.

## Showcase (post-submission)

The stories and clauses in this section are built after submission. Their text
is kept in full so that no requirement is lost. A story here keeps its number
and heading; its old place above holds a pointer to this section.

### US-6: Plain-language fix brief
As an asset owner, I get a short plain-language brief per finding built from
the structured finding (what is affected, why it matters, what version to
move to). (Guardrail design in Stage 2; brief content tests in Stage 4.)
- Acceptance: an open finding shows either a brief whose fix version matches
  the finding's fixed version for this dependency, or the structured finding
  with a visible "brief unavailable" marker; never a brief with a mismatched
  version.

A finding whose brief has not been generated yet shows the structured finding with a 'brief pending' marker; 'brief unavailable' is only for a brief that was rejected, timed out or errored.

### US-9: Overdue reminders, escalation, weekly digest
As a security lead, overdue findings trigger reminders and escalation, and I
get a weekly digest of exposure. A finding's due date is the start of its
current lifecycle plus the window for the highest tier the finding has reached
in that lifecycle. The first lifecycle starts at first detection; after an E7
reopen, the new lifecycle starts at the reopen time, and the first detection
time stays recorded in the audit trail. A tier rise
moves the due date earlier to the new tier's window; a tier drop never moves it
later; an already-overdue finding stays overdue. The windows are an
`ASSUMPTION:` until Stage 2. The escalation target is one configured
security-lead contact (name and email) in deployment configuration, not an
asset record.
- Acceptance: an open finding past its due date produces a reminder to the
  owner and an escalation to the security lead; a weekly digest listing open
  findings by rank is delivered once per week.
- Acceptance: a missing security-lead contact is a visible configuration
  error, not a silent drop.

### US-12: Read-only assistant answers exposure questions
As a developer using an AI assistant, I can ask "which assets are affected by
this CVE?" through the read-only MCP server (tools: `list_top_exposures`,
`which_assets_affected`, `get_finding`, `get_asset`). A lookup by any alias id
returns the same finding(s) as a lookup by the primary id.
- Acceptance: asking for a known CVE returns the affected assets.
- Acceptance: a finding stored under a GHSA id with a CVE alias is returned
  when asked by that CVE.
- Acceptance: a CVE known to the system but affecting no registered asset
  returns an empty asset list, not an error, and states that the CVE is known;
  a CVE not known to the system returns an empty asset list, not an error, and
  states that the CVE is unknown. The two results are distinguishable; the
  exact wire shape is fixed in Stage 3.
- Acceptance: `list_top_exposures` returns ranked open findings.
- Acceptance: `which_assets_affected` returns the affected assets for a known
  CVE, listing its findings in any status, each with its status.
- Acceptance: `get_finding` returns one finding by id.
- Acceptance: `get_asset` returns one asset by id.
- Acceptance: MCP tool output marks advisory-derived text as quoted, labelled
  untrusted data, including in `get_finding` and `which_assets_affected`; no
  advisory text is presented as instructions.
- Acceptance: a write request made with the MCP server's token is rejected by
  the API with a 4xx response and changes no state; the MCP server exposes no
  write tools.

### US-16: n8n workflows are exported into the repo
As a security lead, the n8n workflows that route findings are exported as JSON
into the repository, so the workflow the repo runs is reviewable.
- Acceptance: each workflow has a committed JSON file under `n8n/workflows/`,
  named after the workflow, and the exported file is the workflow the repo
  runs.

### US-8 GitHub tracker issue

The part of US-8 that opened a GitHub tracker issue through n8n. It left US-8
when the backend took over the owner notification. The original wording of the
affected lines is kept here; the owner-notification part is in US-8 above.

Original opening of US-8: "As an asset owner, a new top-priority finding
notifies me and opens a GitHub issue automatically."

Original acceptance lines that mention the GitHub issue:
- Acceptance: a newly appearing top-priority finding produces exactly one
  owner notification and exactly one GitHub issue referencing the finding.
- Acceptance: a finding that leaves and re-enters the top tier without being
  fixed produces no second GitHub issue and no second owner notification; a
  finding that was `fixed` and reappears (E7) starts a new lifecycle and may
  produce at most one new issue and one new notification.
- Acceptance: exactly one owner notification and exactly one GitHub issue are
  created per finding lifecycle, even if the daily refresh runs twice or
  retries after a partial failure. The idempotency basis is the finding
  lifecycle.
- Acceptance: for an ownerless asset, the notification is held and the asset
  is flagged ownerless (E2), while the GitHub issue is still opened once.

Original tracker paragraph:
- The issue is opened in the dedicated tracker repo `vuln-triage-findings`
  using one narrowly scoped token. The token may create, comment on and close
  issues in the dedicated tracker repo `vuln-triage-findings` only; the n8n
  workflow, not the token, limits which of those actions it takes. (`VERIFY:`
  the narrowest GitHub permission that gives these actions on one repository
  is issues read/write on that repository, and it also allows editing issues
  and anything else the check finds.) It cannot push code to any branch or
  change repository settings, and a push attempt with it is refused.
  (`VERIFY:` an issues-only permission excludes contents write and
  administration.) Closing the issue does not change the finding's status;
  n8n may comment on or close the issue after a re-scan marks the finding
  `fixed`.

Edge-case clauses removed from E4 and E7 for the same reason:
- E4: "no second GitHub issue or owner notification if one was already sent (n8n
  closes the tracker issue only after `fixed`, US-8)".
- E7: "at most one new GitHub issue and one new owner notification if it enters
  the top tier".

## Finding statuses

A finding has exactly one status. This is the complete list:

| Status | Set by | Transition and meaning | Audit entry |
|---|---|---|---|
| `open` | Scan or re-scan | Created when a scanned dependency is vulnerable; set again when a `fixed` finding reappears (E7), or when a `withdrawn` finding that was `open` before it was withdrawn has an advisory reinstated and the installed version is inside an affected range (E4). | Creation records the actor and timestamp; each later status change records the previous value, actor and timestamp. |
| `risk accepted` | Asset owner or security lead, in the dashboard | A human accepts the risk; requires a non-empty reason. | Records the signed-in user, timestamp, previous value and the non-empty reason. |
| `fixed` | Re-scan | The installed version no longer falls in any affected range (US-10), including for a `risk accepted` finding (E8). | Records the previous value, actor and timestamp. |
| `withdrawn` | Re-scan | `ASSUMPTION:` an addition to the brief's three statuses. A re-scan sets it when OSV has withdrawn every advisory merged into the finding (E4, E9; `VERIFY:` how OSV marks a withdrawn advisory), including for a `risk accepted` finding (E8); the finding is not deleted. A re-scan that finds an advisory reinstated restores the status the finding had before it was withdrawn (`open` or `risk accepted`), or sets `fixed` if the installed version is outside every affected range (E4). | Records the previous value, the actor (re-scan), the timestamp and OSV as the source. |

`stale` (E3) is a feed marker, not a finding status. The asset scan status
(E3, E5) is not a finding status either.

## Asset scan status

Each asset has exactly one scan status, with exactly these values:
`not yet scanned`, `scan failed`, `scanned, findings`, `scanned, incomplete`,
`scanned, clean`. Only an OSV outage, or a repository or lockfile failure,
gives `scan failed`; a readable repository with no dependency file to read is
a repository failure. A `scan failed` status also records one failure reason,
with exactly these values: `feed unavailable` (OSV unavailable),
`lockfile parse error`, `repository unavailable` (the GitHub repository is
unreachable or missing, or the read-only token is rejected or expired), or
`no dependency files` (the repository is readable but contains none of
`uv.lock`, `requirements.txt` or `package-lock.json`).
For a successful scan the precedence is
`scanned, findings` > `scanned, incomplete` > `scanned, clean`.
"Version unknown" and refused-include warnings (E10) still show under every
value. Findings are listed separately.

Each case gets exactly one value:

- A successful scan matched at least one vulnerability (including when some
  entries are "version unknown" or a `-r` include was refused):
  `scanned, findings`.
- A successful scan matched nothing and at least one entry is "version
  unknown" (E10, including a lockfile entry with no version):
  `scanned, incomplete`.
- A successful scan matched nothing and at least one `-r` include was refused
  (E10): `scanned, incomplete`.
- A successful scan matched nothing, every version is known and no include
  was refused: `scanned, clean`.
- The repository is readable but contains none of `uv.lock`,
  `requirements.txt` or `package-lock.json`: `scan failed`, reason
  `no dependency files`; previous findings are kept and marked stale.
- OSV unavailable on an asset's first scan (E3): `scan failed`, reason
  `feed unavailable`; no findings are created.
- OSV unavailable on a later scan (E3): `scan failed`, reason
  `feed unavailable`; last-known findings are kept and marked stale.
- KEV or EPSS unavailable while OSV succeeded (E3): the value the OSV result
  gives (`scanned, findings`, `scanned, incomplete` or `scanned, clean`); the
  KEV or EPSS signals are marked stale.
- Lockfile parse error (E5): `scan failed`, reason `lockfile parse error`;
  previous findings are kept and marked stale.
- GitHub repository unreachable or the read-only token rejected:
  `scan failed`, reason `repository unavailable`; previous findings are kept
  and marked stale.

The scan status is not a finding status, and the `stale` feed marker is not a
finding status.

## Non-goals (from the brief)

- Servers, network devices, and commercial software.
- Active scanning or penetration testing (the tool only reads inventory).
- Automatic patching (people approve fixes).
- Write tools in the MCP server.

## Advisory-derived text

`VERIFY:` OSV advisory `summary`, `details` and reference fields are free text.
Advisory text is untrusted data and never instructions.

Flows carrying advisory-derived text to a person or an agent, each with its
rule. Rows marked "Showcase" belong to showcase stories and apply when those
stories are built.

| Flow | Rule |
|---|---|
| Showcase: LLM brief (US-6) | Contains only the allowed fields. Its only link is one VulnTriage builds itself from the finding's primary id on a fixed host, the OSV page for that id (`VERIFY:` the OSV page URL pattern for a vulnerability id); no URL from advisory text ever appears in a brief. |
| Owner notification | Plain text with labelled fields. |
| Showcase: US-9 reminder and escalation | Plain text with labelled fields, as for the owner notification. |
| Showcase: Weekly digest (US-9) | Plain text with labelled fields, as for the owner notification. |
| Showcase: E8 "signals changed" notice | Plain text with labelled fields, as for the owner notification. |
| US-14 alert payload (received by the US-15 responder) | Finding id and tier only; no advisory-derived text. Advisory text the responder later reads through the API is untrusted data, never instructions. |
| Showcase: GitHub issue (US-8 GitHub tracker issue) | Opened by n8n in the dedicated tracker repo; advisory-derived text is quoted data, clearly separated from VulnTriage's own text. Under `AGENTS.md`, such issue text is data, not instructions. |
| Showcase: MCP output (US-12) | Advisory-derived text is quoted and labelled untrusted data, including in `get_finding` and `which_assets_affected`; never presented as instructions. |
| Dashboard | Plain text with no auto-links. |

Any URL in advisory text is shown as inert text, and never appears in a brief
(showcase, US-6).

## Edge cases

| # | Case | Expected behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | Package with no fixed version yet | The finding has no fixed version for this dependency. It stays `open` and shows the display text "no fixed version" (display text, not a finding status); it is ranked by exploit signals (tier rule in Stage 2). Showcase (US-6): any brief that names a fix version is rejected, and the structured finding is delivered without the AI brief. |
| E2 | Asset with no owner | Finding is still recorded and ranked; notification is held and the asset is flagged ownerless in the dashboard |
| E3 | A feed (OSV / KEV / EPSS) is unavailable | OSV unavailable on a new asset's first scan: the asset shows `scan failed` with reason `feed unavailable`, no findings are created, and it is not shown as `scanned, clean`. OSV unavailable on a later scan: last-known data and findings are kept and marked stale, not deleted, and the asset shows `scan failed` with reason `feed unavailable`. KEV or EPSS unavailable while OSV succeeded: the asset's scan status is the value the OSV result gives (`scanned, findings`, `scanned, incomplete` or `scanned, clean`), and the last-known KEV or EPSS signals are kept and marked stale. In every case the scheduled run retries |
| E4 | OSV later withdraws an advisory, or a CVE drops out of KEV or EPSS | When a re-scan finds that OSV has withdrawn the advisory (`VERIFY:` how OSV marks or returns a withdrawn advisory), the finding status becomes `withdrawn` (`ASSUMPTION:` addition to the brief's three statuses), not `fixed`, even if the advisory no longer matches the installed version; the finding is not deleted, and the audit entry records the previous value, the actor (re-scan), the timestamp and OSV as the source. A `risk accepted` finding becomes `withdrawn` too: the audit entry records `risk accepted` as the previous value, and no owner notification is sent. A finding with several merged advisories (E9) becomes `withdrawn` only when every one of them is withdrawn. An advisory that is already withdrawn when a scan first sees it creates no finding; the only status a scan creates is `open`. If a later re-scan finds any of a `withdrawn` finding's advisories no longer withdrawn (`VERIFY:` how OSV shows a reinstated advisory) and the installed version is inside an affected range, the finding returns to the status it had before it was withdrawn (`open`, or `risk accepted` if a person had accepted it) and resumes its earlier lifecycle: no second owner notification if one was already sent (US-8). Returning to `risk accepted` restores the human's earlier acceptance as recorded in the audit trail (who, when and the reason); it is not a new acceptance, and the re-scan never sets `risk accepted` on a finding no person had accepted. If the installed version is outside every affected range, it becomes `fixed`. Each of these changes records the previous value, the actor (re-scan), the timestamp and OSV as the source; a restored acceptance also names the audit entry it restores. The scheduled KEV/EPSS refresh never changes a finding's status: a CVE dropping out of KEV or EPSS changes that finding's signals and rank (US-7), not its status |
| E5 | Lockfile fails to parse | The asset's scan status is `scan failed` with reason `lockfile parse error`; previous findings are kept and marked stale; the error is visible in the dashboard |
| E6 | A telemetry backend is unavailable | Buffer in-process and retry; findings, notifications and alerts are unaffected; the gap is visible in Grafana |
| E7 | A `fixed` finding's vulnerable version comes back (downgrade or revert) | The finding returns to `open` with an audit entry giving the previous value and the reason, and starts a new notification lifecycle under the US-8 rules: at most one new owner notification if it enters the top tier |
| E8 | A `risk accepted` finding's signals escalate (for example it becomes KEV-listed) | The status stays `risk accepted` because a human set it, and the finding is flagged "signals changed" in the dashboard. It does not silently reopen. Showcase: the owner and security lead are also notified once, so it does not silently stay quiet; submission scope builds the flag but no notice. A re-scan may still close it: it becomes `fixed` (US-10) or `withdrawn` (E4), with `risk accepted` recorded as the previous value and no owner notification |
| E9 | One vulnerability is reported under two ids (for example a GHSA and a PYSEC advisory for the same CVE) | `VERIFY:` OSV records carry alias sets. Two records are the same vulnerability when their alias sets intersect; the finding is keyed by the CVE when present, otherwise by the primary advisory id. The asset gets one finding per (asset, package, vulnerability identity), with all advisory ids and affected ranges attached, not two findings. Its fixed version is derived under the "fixed version for this dependency" rule from all merged affected ranges. One finding means at most one US-8 notification per lifecycle |
| E10 | A `requirements.txt` entry has no exact version (`requests>=2`, bare `requests`, an environment marker, or a `-r` include) | Record the entry with "version unknown", show a visible warning, and make no OSV match; a scan where nothing matched and at least one entry is "version unknown" is `scanned, incomplete`. `-r` includes are resolved only inside the repository; an include outside the repository or a remote URL is refused and reported as a scan warning, never fetched, and its entries are never read; a scan where nothing matched and at least one include was refused is `scanned, incomplete`. A `uv.lock` or `package-lock.json` entry with no version, other than the project's own package and local link or workspace entries, is also recorded as "version unknown" with a visible warning and no OSV match, and counts toward `scanned, incomplete` the same way (`VERIFY:` which lockfile entries carry no version) |
| E11 | A vulnerability has no CVE alias | `VERIFY:` KEV and EPSS are keyed by CVE. KEV shows `KEV: n/a (no CVE)`, EPSS shows `n/a`, and the finding is still recorded and ranked. No advisory is dropped only because it has no CVE |
| E12 | Advisory text contains instructions or links | Showcase for the brief clause (US-6); the other rules apply to every surface in submission scope. The instructions are never followed; the text never chooses a tool, command, URL, file path or credential. The brief contains only the allowed fields; its only link is the one VulnTriage builds from the finding's primary id (Advisory-derived text), and no URL from advisory text ever appears in it; every URL in advisory text is shown as inert text |

## Open questions

1. What counts as "top-priority" for US-8 notification (which tier)? — the
   top tier is `P1`, defined by Stage 2; this is a blocker for Stage 2
   sign-off. Answered in `_docs/architecture.md` § Prioritisation.
2. What are the overdue/escalation time windows for US-9?
3. Which notification channel (email / chat) does the pilot use for US-8/US-9?
4. What is the notification window for US-14 (how long before an undelivered
   top-priority finding fires the alert)?
5. What credential does the responder use, and how is it scoped (branch and
   pull request only, no push to main)? Does a human merge or an automatic
   merge after CI passes complete US-15? Answered in `_docs/architecture.md`
   § Responder agent (a human merges; #43 D2).

## Assumptions

- ASSUMPTION: "asset criticality" is a small fixed set (e.g.
  low/medium/high/critical); final values in Stage 2.
- ASSUMPTION: pilot repos plus OWASP Juice Shop give real findings; pilot
  asset list in a later stage.
- ASSUMPTION: an asset owner has a name and a contact email. An asset is ownerless when both are unset; if only one is set, the asset is not ownerless and the dashboard shows the missing field. Whether a partial owner is notified is decided in Stage 2.

## Suggested additions (not in the plan unless approved)

- Severity scores (e.g. CVSS) as a display-only field alongside KEV/EPSS, if
  wanted.
